# Fresh Install Reset

## Purpose

Reset Nexus-v4 to a clean "factory default" state suitable for distribution/handout to new users. Remove all user-specific content, development artifacts, and sensitive data while preserving the core system framework.

**Key Outcome**: A new user can clone/download and run `--startup` to get a fully functional, empty system ready for personalization.

---

## Success Criteria

**Must achieve**:
- [x] Backup exists at `Nexus-v4-improvements/`
- [ ] All user projects deleted (01-04, 00-onboarding)
- [ ] All memory files deleted (auto-regenerated by nexus-loader)
- [ ] All integration caches deleted
- [ ] User skills folder empty (README only)
- [ ] Workspace folder empty (README only)
- [ ] Dev/test artifacts removed
- [ ] Internal documentation projects removed (06, 07)
- [ ] Sensitive files protected (.env, .mcp.json gitignored)
- [ ] `--startup` runs clean with empty menu
- [ ] Learning skills functional for new user onboarding

**Nice to have**:
- [ ] init-memory.py removed if redundant
- [ ] README files explain each empty folder's purpose

---

## Context

**Background**: Nexus-v4 has been developed with user-specific projects, integration caches (Airtable, Notion), test files, and internal documentation projects. For distribution, all this must be cleaned while keeping the system functional.

**Key Discovery**: The old onboarding system (`02-projects/00-onboarding/`) is now obsolete - replaced by learning skills in `00-system/skills/learning/` (setup-goals, learn-projects, learn-skills, learn-nexus, setup-workspace).

**Key Discovery**: Memory files (goals.md, user-config.yaml, etc.) are auto-regenerated by `nexus-loader.py` using `SMART_DEFAULT_*` templates on first startup. Safe to delete entirely.

**Stakeholders**:
- New Nexus users (need clean starting point)
- Distribution recipients (handout)

**Constraints**:
- Cannot delete .env (gitignored, user keeps their own)
- Must preserve 00-system/ framework entirely
- Learning skills must remain functional

---

## Timeline

**Target**: Single session execution

**Milestones**:
- Phase 1-2: Delete user content (projects, onboarding) - 2 min
- Phase 3-5: Clear memory, skills, workspace - 2 min
- Phase 6-8: Delete dev artifacts and internal docs - 3 min
- Phase 9-10: Final cleanup and verification - 3 min
