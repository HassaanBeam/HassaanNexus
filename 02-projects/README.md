# Projects

This folder contains your **temporal work** - tasks with a beginning, middle, and end.

## Creating Projects

Say **"create project"** to start a new project with AI-guided planning.

## Structure

Each project follows this structure:
```
{ID}-{project-name}/
├── 01-planning/     # overview.md, plan.md, steps.md
├── 02-resources/    # Reference materials
├── 03-working/      # Work in progress
└── 04-outputs/      # Final deliverables
```

## Projects vs Skills

- **Projects** = One-time work (finite deliverable)
- **Skills** = Reusable workflows (repeatable process)
