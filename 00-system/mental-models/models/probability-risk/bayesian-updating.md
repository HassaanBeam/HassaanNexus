# Bayesian Updating

**Purpose**: Revise beliefs based on new evidence

## The Concept

Start with a belief (prior). When new evidence arrives, update your belief (posterior) based on how likely that evidence is under different hypotheses.

## Process

1. State your **prior** belief (probability before evidence)
2. Observe **new evidence**
3. Ask: How likely is this evidence if my belief is true? If false?
4. Update to **posterior** belief

## Questions to Ask

- What did we believe before this evidence?
- How likely is this evidence if we're right? If we're wrong?
- How should this evidence change our belief?
- Are we updating enough (or too much)?
- What evidence would change our minds significantly?

## Intuitive Example

**Prior**: "70% chance it will rain today" (based on forecast)

**Evidence**: You look outside and see dark clouds

**Update**: Dark clouds are MORE likely if it will rain. Increase probability to maybe 85%.

**New Evidence**: Friend texts that it's sunny across town

**Update**: Decrease probability somewhat, maybe to 70% again.

## Common Mistakes

- **Not updating**: Ignoring evidence that contradicts beliefs
- **Over-updating**: Changing belief too much on single data point
- **Base rate neglect**: Ignoring how common something is overall

## Key Insight

Strong priors require strong evidence to change. Weak priors can shift on little evidence.

## Output

Updated probability estimate incorporating new evidence
