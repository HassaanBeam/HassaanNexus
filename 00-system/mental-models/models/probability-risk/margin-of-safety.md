# Margin of Safety

**Purpose**: Build buffer for errors and uncertainty

## The Principle

Always include buffer beyond minimum requirements. The world is more uncertain than we think.

## Questions to Ask

- What's the minimum needed?
- What margin should we add for safety (10%? 50%? 2x?)
- What could go wrong that we're not anticipating?
- What's the cost of being wrong vs. cost of extra margin?
- Where are we most uncertain?

## Applications

| Domain | Margin of Safety |
|--------|------------------|
| Engineering | Bridge rated 3x expected load |
| Investing | Buy at 30%+ below intrinsic value |
| Project planning | Add 20-50% buffer to estimates |
| Budgeting | Keep emergency fund |
| Deadlines | Promise later, deliver earlier |

## How Much Margin?

Depends on:
- **Uncertainty**: More unknown = more margin
- **Downside**: Worse failure = more margin
- **Cost of margin**: Expensive margin = less margin
- **Reversibility**: Irreversible = more margin

## Rule of Thumb

| Situation | Margin |
|-----------|--------|
| Well-understood, reversible | 10-20% |
| Some uncertainty | 25-50% |
| High uncertainty | 50-100% |
| Critical, irreversible | 100%+ (2x or more) |

## Common Mistake

Optimizing away the margin to hit targets. This works until it doesn't—then fails catastrophically.

## Output

Requirements with appropriate safety buffers
