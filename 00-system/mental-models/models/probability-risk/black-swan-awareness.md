# Black Swan Awareness

**Purpose**: Account for high-impact rare events

## What is a Black Swan?

Named by Nassim Taleb. Three characteristics:

1. **Rare**: Outside normal expectations
2. **Extreme impact**: Massive consequences
3. **Retrospective predictability**: Explained in hindsight, but not foreseen

## Questions to Ask

- What rare events could have massive impact?
- Are we exposed to negative Black Swans?
- Can we position for positive Black Swans?
- How fragile vs. antifragile is our position?
- What would we do if [extreme scenario] happened?

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Fragile** | Breaks under stress |
| **Robust** | Survives stress |
| **Antifragile** | Gets stronger from stress |

## Strategies

### Reduce Exposure to Negative Black Swans
- Avoid single points of failure
- Maintain reserves/optionality
- Don't bet everything on one outcome
- Have insurance/hedges

### Increase Exposure to Positive Black Swans
- Take many small bets
- Stay in games with upside potential
- Position near innovation
- Build optionality

## The Barbell Strategy

- 85-90% in very safe assets
- 10-15% in very speculative bets
- Nothing in the middle

This limits downside while maintaining upside.

## Examples

- **Negative**: 2008 financial crisis, pandemic
- **Positive**: Google, bitcoin, viral product success

## Output

Exposure assessment and antifragility strategies
