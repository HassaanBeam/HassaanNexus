# Regret Minimization

**Purpose**: Choose to minimize future regret

## The Framework (Jeff Bezos Version)

1. Project yourself to age 80
2. Look back at this decision
3. Ask: "Will I regret NOT doing this?"
4. Minimize the regret

## Questions to Ask

- When I'm 80, will I regret not trying this?
- What's the regret of action vs. inaction?
- What's the asymmetry of regret?
- Will I regret this if it fails? Or regret not trying?
- What would I tell my future self?

## The Asymmetry of Regret

Often, we regret things we DIDN'T do more than things we DID do (that failed).

| Action Regret | Inaction Regret |
|---------------|-----------------|
| "I tried and failed" | "I never tried" |
| Often fades with time | Often grows with time |
| At least you know | Forever wondering |

## When to Use

- Career changes
- Starting a business
- Moving cities
- Ending/starting relationships
- Major purchases
- Taking risks

## Bezos Example

When deciding to start Amazon, Bezos asked: "When I'm 80, will I regret leaving a good job to try this?" Answer: No. "Will I regret NOT trying?" Answer: Yes.

## Process

1. Identify the decision
2. Imagine yourself at 80
3. Ask both versions of the regret question
4. Choose the path with less regret
5. Accept the outcome either way

## Key Insight

Failure after trying is usually less painful than never trying at all.

## Output

Decision aligned with long-term regret minimization
