# Expected Value

**Purpose**: Probability-weighted outcome calculation

## The Formula

**EV = Σ (Probability × Outcome)**

Sum of each possible outcome multiplied by its probability.

## Questions to Ask

- What are all possible outcomes?
- What's the probability of each outcome?
- What's the value (positive or negative) of each outcome?
- What's the expected value of each option?
- Is the expected value positive?
- Am I considering downside risk, not just average?

## Example

**Decision**: Launch new product

| Outcome | Probability | Value | EV Contribution |
|---------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| Big success | 20% | +$1M | +$200K |
| Moderate success | 40% | +$200K | +$80K |
| Break even | 25% | $0 | $0 |
| Failure | 15% | -$300K | -$45K |
| **Expected Value** | | | **+$235K** |

## Process

1. List all possible outcomes
2. Estimate probability of each (must sum to 100%)
3. Estimate value of each outcome
4. Multiply probability × value for each
5. Sum to get expected value
6. Compare to alternatives

## Limitations

- Doesn't account for variance/risk tolerance
- Single big loss might be unacceptable
- Probabilities are estimates
- Ignores non-financial factors

## Risk-Adjusted Thinking

A +$100K EV with low variance may be better than +$150K EV with high variance, depending on your risk tolerance.

## Output

Expected value calculation for each option
