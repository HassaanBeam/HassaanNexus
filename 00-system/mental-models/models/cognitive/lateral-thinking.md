# Lateral Thinking

**Purpose**: Generate creative alternatives through non-linear paths

## Questions to Ask

- What if we approached this from a completely different angle?
- What would someone from a different industry do?
- What assumptions are we making that we could challenge?
- What if we did the opposite of the obvious solution?
- What random element could we introduce?
- How would a child approach this? An artist? A scientist?

## Techniques

- **Random entry**: Introduce unrelated concepts
- **Reversal**: Do the opposite
- **Analogy**: Borrow from other domains
- **Distortion**: Exaggerate or minimize elements
- **Wishful thinking**: Imagine ideal outcomes

## Process

1. State the problem
2. Deliberately avoid obvious solutions
3. Use techniques to shift perspective
4. Generate many alternatives without judgment
5. Evaluate and refine promising ideas

## Output

Unconventional alternatives and fresh perspectives
