# Second-Order Thinking

**Purpose**: Consider consequences of consequences

## Questions to Ask

- And then what? (repeat 3-5 times)
- What are the first-order effects of this decision?
- What are the second-order effects of those effects?
- Who else will be affected, and how will they respond?
- What feedback loops might this create?
- What might happen in 1 month? 1 year? 5 years?
- What unintended consequences might emerge?

## The Principle

First-order thinking: What happens immediately?
Second-order thinking: What happens as a result of that?
Third-order and beyond: What happens next?

## Process

1. Identify the action or decision
2. List immediate (first-order) effects
3. For each effect, ask "and then what?"
4. Continue for 3-5 levels
5. Map the chain of consequences
6. Look for unexpected or negative downstream effects

## Example

**Decision**: Cut prices by 20%
**First-order**: More sales!
**Second-order**: Competitors match prices
**Third-order**: Industry-wide margin compression
**Fourth-order**: Less R&D investment, worse products

## Output

Chain of consequences across multiple time horizons
