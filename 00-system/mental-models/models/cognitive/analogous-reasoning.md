# Analogous Reasoning

**Purpose**: Apply patterns from similar domains

## Questions to Ask

- Has anyone solved a similar problem before?
- What domains have faced analogous challenges?
- What can we learn from their approach?
- What worked well? What didn't?
- How does our context differ from the analogy?
- Which elements transfer and which don't?

## Process

1. Define the problem clearly
2. Search for analogous situations in other domains
3. Study how they solved it
4. Extract transferable principles
5. Adapt to your specific context

## Cautions

- Analogies can mislead if contexts differ significantly
- Surface similarities may hide deep differences
- Always validate transferred assumptions

## Output

Lessons and patterns from analogous situations
