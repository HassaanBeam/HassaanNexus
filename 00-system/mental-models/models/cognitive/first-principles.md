# First Principles

**Purpose**: Strip away assumptions to find fundamental truths

## Questions to Ask

- What's the absolute core problem we're solving?
- If we stripped away all assumptions, what remains?
- What are the fundamental requirements (not nice-to-haves)?
- What would this look like if we designed from scratch?
- What do we KNOW to be true vs. what do we ASSUME to be true?
- What are the physics/economics/constraints that cannot be changed?

## Process

1. Identify the problem or goal
2. List all current assumptions
3. Challenge each assumption - is it truly necessary?
4. Identify the fundamental truths that remain
5. Build up from those truths

## Output

List of fundamental truths and core requirements

## Example

**Problem**: "We need a faster horse"
**First Principles**: What's the fundamental need? → Transportation from A to B quickly
**Result**: Leads to cars, not faster horses
