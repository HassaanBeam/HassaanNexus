# Systems Thinking

**Purpose**: Understand how parts interact within the whole

## Questions to Ask

- What are the major components of this system?
- How do these components interact with each other?
- What feedback loops exist (reinforcing or balancing)?
- What are the inputs and outputs of each component?
- What happens if one component fails or changes?
- Where are the leverage points—small changes with big effects?
- What are the delays in the system?

## Key Concepts

- **Reinforcing loops**: Changes that amplify (growth or decline)
- **Balancing loops**: Changes that stabilize
- **Delays**: Time gaps between action and effect
- **Leverage points**: Places where small changes have big impact

## Process

1. Map the components
2. Identify connections and dependencies
3. Find feedback loops
4. Locate delays
5. Identify leverage points

## Output

System map with components, connections, and feedback loops
