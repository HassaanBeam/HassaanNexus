# Inversion

**Purpose**: Solve problems by considering the opposite

## Questions to Ask

- What would guarantee failure here?
- What should we definitely NOT do?
- If we wanted to make this worse, how would we do it?
- What are all the ways this could go wrong?
- What's the opposite of our goal, and how do we avoid it?
- Instead of "how to succeed," ask "how to avoid failing"

## The Principle

Instead of asking "How do I achieve X?", ask "How do I avoid not-X?"

## Process

1. Define what you want to achieve
2. Invert: List all the ways to fail or achieve the opposite
3. Study each failure mode
4. Create plans to avoid each failure
5. What remains is more likely to succeed

## Example

**Goal**: Build a great team
**Inverted**: How to build a terrible team?
- Hire people who don't communicate
- Ignore conflicts
- No clear goals
**Solution**: Do the opposite of each

## Output

List of things to avoid and anti-patterns
