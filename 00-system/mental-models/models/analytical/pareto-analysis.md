# Pareto Analysis (80/20)

**Purpose**: Prioritization based on impact concentration

## The Principle

~80% of effects come from ~20% of causes. Focus on the vital few, not the trivial many.

## Questions to Ask

- Which 20% of inputs create 80% of outputs?
- Which 20% of customers generate 80% of revenue?
- Which 20% of problems cause 80% of complaints?
- Which 20% of features deliver 80% of value?
- What should we focus on? What can we ignore?

## Common Applications

| Domain | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Sales | Which customers drive most revenue? |
| Bugs | Which issues cause most problems? |
| Features | Which features deliver most value? |
| Time | Which activities create most results? |
| Costs | Which items represent most spending? |

## Process

1. List all items (customers, features, problems, etc.)
2. Quantify the impact of each
3. Sort by impact (descending)
4. Calculate cumulative percentage
5. Identify the ~20% that drive ~80%
6. Focus resources on those

## Visualization

Create a Pareto chart:
- Bar chart of items sorted by frequency/impact
- Line showing cumulative percentage
- The steep part of the curve = vital few

## Output

Prioritized list of high-impact items
