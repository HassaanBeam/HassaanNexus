# Assumption Testing

**Purpose**: Identify and validate critical assumptions

## Questions to Ask

- What are we assuming is true?
- Which assumptions are most critical to success?
- Which assumptions are most uncertain?
- How can we test each assumption cheaply and quickly?
- What would change if the assumption is wrong?
- What's the riskiest assumption?

## Assumption Categories

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Value** | Customers want this | "Users will pay for premium features" |
| **Growth** | We can scale | "Word of mouth will drive adoption" |
| **Technical** | We can build it | "The API can handle 10K requests/sec" |
| **Financial** | The numbers work | "CAC will be under $50" |

## Risk Matrix

Plot assumptions on:
- X-axis: Uncertainty (how sure are we?)
- Y-axis: Impact (how bad if wrong?)

**Priority**: High uncertainty + High impact = Test first

## Process

1. List all assumptions
2. Categorize by type
3. Rate uncertainty and impact
4. Prioritize riskiest assumptions
5. Design cheap, fast tests for each
6. Run tests, update beliefs
7. Adjust plans based on learnings

## Testing Methods

- Customer interviews
- Landing page tests
- Prototypes
- Small pilots
- Data analysis

## Output

Assumption inventory with test plans
