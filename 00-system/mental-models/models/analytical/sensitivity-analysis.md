# Sensitivity Analysis

**Purpose**: Test how changes in inputs affect outputs

## Questions to Ask

- What are the key input variables?
- What happens if each variable changes by ±10%, 25%, 50%?
- Which variables have the biggest impact on outcomes?
- What's the break-even point for each variable?
- Which variables are we most uncertain about?
- Where should we focus our estimation efforts?

## Types of Sensitivity Analysis

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **One-at-a-time** | Change one variable, hold others constant |
| **Scenario** | Change multiple variables together |
| **Monte Carlo** | Probabilistic simulation of all variables |

## Process

1. Build your model (financial, operational, etc.)
2. Identify key input variables
3. Define reasonable ranges for each variable
4. Test each variable across its range
5. Record impact on output
6. Create sensitivity table or tornado chart
7. Focus attention on high-impact, uncertain variables

## Visualization

**Tornado Chart**: Horizontal bars showing impact of each variable
- Longest bars = most sensitive variables
- Focus estimation and risk mitigation here

## Key Questions Answered

- "What if costs are 20% higher?"
- "What if conversion rate drops by half?"
- "Which assumption would break the business case?"

## Output

Sensitivity table/tornado chart showing impact of variables
