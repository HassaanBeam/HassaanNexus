# Decision Matrix

**Purpose**: Multi-criteria weighted evaluation

## Process

1. List all viable options (rows)
2. Define evaluation criteria (columns)
3. Weight each criterion by importance (total = 100%)
4. Score each option on each criterion (1-10)
5. Calculate weighted scores
6. Compare results

## Questions to Ask

- What are all the viable options?
- What criteria matter most?
- What weight (1-10 or %) should each criterion have?
- How does each option score on each criterion?
- Does the result match your intuition? If not, why?

## Example

| Option | Cost (30%) | Speed (25%) | Quality (25%) | Risk (20%) | Total |
|--------|------------|-------------|---------------|------------|-------|
| Option A | 8×0.3=2.4 | 6×0.25=1.5 | 7×0.25=1.75 | 5×0.2=1.0 | 6.65 |
| Option B | 5×0.3=1.5 | 8×0.25=2.0 | 8×0.25=2.0 | 7×0.2=1.4 | 6.90 |
| Option C | 7×0.3=2.1 | 7×0.25=1.75 | 6×0.25=1.5 | 8×0.2=1.6 | 6.95 |

## Tips

- If result feels wrong, examine your weights
- Include "must-have" criteria as pass/fail filters
- Consider sensitivity analysis on weights
- Use as discussion starter, not final answer

## Output

Ranked options with rationale
