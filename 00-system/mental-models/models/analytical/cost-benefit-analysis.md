# Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Purpose**: Quantified impact analysis with ROI

## Questions to Ask

- What are ALL the costs (direct, indirect, opportunity)?
- What are ALL the benefits (tangible and intangible)?
- What's the time horizon?
- What discount rate should we use?
- What's the payback period?
- What's the ROI?
- What assumptions are we making?

## Cost Categories

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Direct** | Purchase price, labor, materials |
| **Indirect** | Training, maintenance, support |
| **Opportunity** | What else could we do with these resources? |
| **Hidden** | Transition costs, productivity loss |

## Benefit Categories

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Tangible** | Revenue increase, cost savings |
| **Intangible** | Brand value, employee satisfaction |
| **Direct** | Immediate savings |
| **Indirect** | Enabled future opportunities |

## Key Metrics

- **ROI**: (Benefits - Costs) / Costs × 100%
- **Payback Period**: Time to recover investment
- **NPV**: Net Present Value (accounts for time value of money)
- **BCR**: Benefit-Cost Ratio (Benefits / Costs)

## Process

1. Define scope and time horizon
2. List all costs and benefits
3. Quantify each (use estimates where needed)
4. Calculate key metrics
5. Sensitivity test key assumptions
6. Make recommendation

## Output

Net present value, ROI, and payback period
