# Time Boxing

**Purpose**: Fixed time allocation forcing completion

## The Concept

Allocate a fixed amount of time to a task. When time expires, you stop—regardless of whether you're "done."

## Process

1. Define the task clearly
2. Allocate fixed time (e.g., 25 min, 2 hours, 1 day)
3. Work only on that task during the time box
4. Stop when time expires (regardless of completion)
5. Assess and decide next steps

## Questions to Ask

- How much time should this realistically take?
- What's the minimum viable version if time runs out?
- What's the maximum time I should spend on this?
- What can I accomplish in [X] minutes/hours?

## Common Time Boxes

| Duration | Good For |
|----------|----------|
| 25 min (Pomodoro) | Focused work sessions |
| 50-90 min | Deep work blocks |
| Half day | Major tasks |
| 1 day | Project phases |
| 1 week | Sprint/iteration |

## Benefits

- Forces prioritization
- Prevents perfectionism
- Creates urgency
- Makes work measurable
- Protects from scope creep

## Tips

- Set a visible timer
- Remove distractions
- Define "done enough" before starting
- Take breaks between boxes
- Review what you accomplished

## Parkinson's Law

"Work expands to fill the time available."

Time boxing uses this in reverse—constraining time constrains scope.

## Output

Completed work within time constraint
