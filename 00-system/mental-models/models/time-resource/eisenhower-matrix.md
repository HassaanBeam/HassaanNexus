# Eisenhower Matrix

**Purpose**: Urgent vs Important prioritization

## The Four Quadrants

|  | **Urgent** | **Not Urgent** |
|--|------------|----------------|
| **Important** | **DO** (crises, deadlines) | **SCHEDULE** (strategy, growth) |
| **Not Important** | **DELEGATE** (interruptions) | **ELIMINATE** (time-wasters) |

## Questions to Ask

- Is this urgent (time-sensitive)?
- Is this important (high-impact)?
- What quadrant does each task fall into?
- Am I spending too much time in Urgent/Not Important?
- How can I spend more time in Important/Not Urgent?

## Quadrant Details

### Q1: Do (Urgent + Important)
- Crises, emergencies
- Deadline-driven projects
- Last-minute preparations

**Strategy**: Handle immediately, but aim to reduce these through better Q2 work

### Q2: Schedule (Not Urgent + Important)
- Strategic planning
- Relationship building
- Prevention, preparation
- Learning and growth

**Strategy**: This is where you want to spend most time. Schedule it!

### Q3: Delegate (Urgent + Not Important)
- Most interruptions
- Some meetings
- Some calls/emails

**Strategy**: Delegate to others or batch process

### Q4: Eliminate (Not Urgent + Not Important)
- Time-wasters
- Excessive social media
- Busy work
- Some emails

**Strategy**: Eliminate or minimize

## Key Insight

Spending more time in Q2 reduces crises in Q1.

## Output

Prioritized task list with appropriate actions
