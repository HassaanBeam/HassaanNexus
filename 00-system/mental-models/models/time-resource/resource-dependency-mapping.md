# Resource Dependency Mapping

**Purpose**: Identify critical resource constraints

## Questions to Ask

- What resources does this project require?
- Which resources are shared or constrained?
- What depends on what (dependency chain)?
- What's the critical path?
- What happens if a key resource is unavailable?
- Where do we need slack/buffer?

## Resource Categories

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **People** | Skills, availability, attention |
| **Money** | Budget, cash flow, funding |
| **Time** | Deadlines, schedules, availability |
| **Equipment** | Tools, systems, infrastructure |
| **Information** | Data, decisions, approvals |
| **External** | Vendors, partners, customers |

## Process

1. List all required resources
2. Identify constraints for each
3. Map dependencies (what needs what, when)
4. Find critical path (longest dependency chain)
5. Identify single points of failure
6. Build in slack/buffer for high-risk resources
7. Create contingency plans

## Dependency Types

- **Finish-to-Start**: B can't start until A finishes
- **Start-to-Start**: B can't start until A starts
- **Finish-to-Finish**: B can't finish until A finishes
- **Start-to-Finish**: B can't finish until A starts

## Critical Path

The longest chain of dependent activities. Delay here = project delay.

## Risk Indicators

- Single person with critical knowledge
- Shared resource across multiple projects
- External dependency with no control
- No buffer in schedule

## Output

Resource map with dependencies and critical path
