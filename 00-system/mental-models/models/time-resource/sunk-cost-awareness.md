# Sunk Cost Awareness

**Purpose**: Ignore past investments in future decisions

## The Principle

Past costs are irrelevant to future decisions. Only future costs and benefits matter.

## The Sunk Cost Fallacy

"I've already invested X, so I should continue" — This is WRONG.

The money/time/effort is gone regardless of what you decide next. Your decision should be based on:
- What will it cost going FORWARD?
- What will you gain going FORWARD?

## Questions to Ask

- Am I continuing this because it's the best path forward, or because I've already invested?
- If I were starting fresh today, would I begin this project?
- What would I advise a friend to do (ignoring what they've spent)?
- What's the best use of resources going FORWARD?

## Examples

**Bad reasoning** (sunk cost fallacy):
- "I've read 200 pages, I must finish this terrible book"
- "We've spent $1M on this project, we can't stop now"
- "I've been in this career for 10 years, I can't switch"

**Good reasoning** (forward-looking):
- "Will finishing this book be the best use of my next 3 hours?"
- "Given where we are now, is continuing the best use of future resources?"
- "What's the best path forward from here?"

## How to Overcome

1. Ask: "Would I start this today knowing what I know?"
2. Imagine advising a friend
3. Focus only on future costs/benefits
4. Accept the loss as already realized

## Output

Clear-eyed decision based on future value, not past investment
