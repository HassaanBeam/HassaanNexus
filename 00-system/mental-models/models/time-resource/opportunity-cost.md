# Opportunity Cost

**Purpose**: Understand what you give up by choosing

## Core Concept

The opportunity cost is the value of the BEST alternative you're giving up. Every choice has a hidden cost.

## The Formula

**True Cost = Direct Cost + Opportunity Cost**

## Questions to Ask

- If I do X, what can't I do?
- What's the value of the next best alternative?
- What's the true cost of this choice (money + opportunity)?
- Am I considering ALL my options?
- What would I do with these resources otherwise?

## Examples

| Decision | Direct Cost | Opportunity Cost |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Attend meeting | 1 hour | Deep work you could have done |
| Build vs buy | Dev time | Faster time to market buying |
| Hire FTE | Salary | What contractors could do |
| College | Tuition | 4 years of working income |

## Common Mistakes

- Only considering direct costs
- Not identifying the best alternative
- Ignoring time as a resource
- Failing to quantify opportunity costs

## Process

1. List all options
2. Identify the best alternative to your preferred choice
3. Estimate value of that alternative
4. Add to direct costs for true cost
5. Compare true costs of all options

## Key Insight

"Free" things aren't free—they cost your time, attention, or other opportunities.

## Output

True cost analysis including foregone alternatives
