# Design Thinking

**Purpose**: Human-centered problem-solving process

## The Five Stages

| Stage | Focus | Activities |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **Empathize** | Understand users | Observe, interview, immerse |
| **Define** | Frame the problem | Synthesize insights, create POV |
| **Ideate** | Generate solutions | Brainstorm, diverge, explore |
| **Prototype** | Make it tangible | Build quick, cheap representations |
| **Test** | Learn and iterate | Get feedback, refine |

## Questions to Ask

- Who are we designing for? What do they need?
- What's the real problem we're solving?
- How might we...? (generate many ideas)
- What's the quickest way to test this?
- What did we learn? What should we change?

## Key Principles

- **Human-centered**: Start with real user needs
- **Bias to action**: Build to think
- **Radical collaboration**: Diverse perspectives
- **Fail early**: Learn quickly and cheaply
- **Iterate**: Design is never done

## Process

1. **Empathize**: Research, observe, interview users
2. **Define**: Create "How Might We" statement
3. **Ideate**: Generate many ideas without judgment
4. **Prototype**: Build quick representations
5. **Test**: Get user feedback
6. **Repeat**: Iterate based on learnings

## Output

User-validated solution through rapid iteration
