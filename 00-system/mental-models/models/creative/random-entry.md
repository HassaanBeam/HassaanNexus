# Random Entry

**Purpose**: Introduce random stimulus to break patterns

## The Concept

Introduce an unrelated, random element and force connections between it and your problem. The randomness bypasses established thinking patterns.

## Process

1. Define your problem/challenge clearly
2. Select a random word, image, object, or concept
3. List attributes, functions, or associations of the random element
4. Force connections between the random element and your problem
5. Extract insights and new directions

## Questions to Ask

- How is [random element] like our problem?
- What attributes of [random element] could we apply?
- What does this random connection suggest?
- What new directions does this open up?
- What would our solution look like if it were more like [random element]?

## Ways to Generate Random Stimulus

- Open a dictionary to a random word
- Pick a random image
- Use a random object nearby
- Select a random Wikipedia article
- Ask someone for a random word

## Example

**Problem**: Improve customer service
**Random word**: "Octopus"

Octopus attributes: Multiple arms, camouflage, intelligent, flexible, ink defense

**Connections**:
- Multiple arms → Multi-channel support (chat, phone, email simultaneously)
- Camouflage → Adapt communication style to customer
- Ink defense → Give customers escape routes when things go wrong

## Output

Unexpected connections and novel ideas
