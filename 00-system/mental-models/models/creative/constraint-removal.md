# Constraint Removal

**Purpose**: Challenge limitations to unlock creativity

## The Concept

Temporarily remove real or perceived constraints to imagine ideal solutions, then work backward to see which constraints truly matter.

## Questions to Ask

- What if we had unlimited budget?
- What if we had unlimited time?
- What if we had no technical limitations?
- What if we had no regulatory constraints?
- What if we started completely from scratch?
- What if we had perfect information?
- Which constraints are real vs. self-imposed?
- Which constraints could we actually challenge?

## Process

1. List all current constraints (real and perceived)
2. Remove them one by one and ask "what would we do?"
3. Design the ideal, unconstrained solution
4. Add constraints back one at a time
5. For each constraint, ask: "Is this truly immovable?"
6. Identify constraints worth challenging
7. Find creative ways around remaining constraints

## Constraint Categories

| Type | Examples | Often Challengeable? |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| Budget | "We only have $X" | Sometimes |
| Time | "It must be done by Y" | Sometimes |
| Technical | "The system can't do Z" | Often |
| Policy | "We've always done it this way" | Often |
| Physical | "Laws of physics" | Rarely |
| Regulatory | "It's against the rules" | Sometimes |

## Key Insight

Many "constraints" are actually assumptions. The unconstrained ideal reveals which ones we should challenge.

## Output

Idealized solution revealing which constraints matter most
