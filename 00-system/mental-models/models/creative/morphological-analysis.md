# Morphological Analysis

**Purpose**: Systematic exploration of solution space

## The Concept

Break a problem into independent dimensions, list possible values for each, then systematically explore combinations.

## Process

1. Identify key dimensions/parameters of the problem
2. List all possible values for each dimension
3. Create a matrix of all combinations
4. Systematically explore combinations
5. Identify promising novel solutions

## Questions to Ask

- What are the key dimensions of this problem?
- What are all possible values for each dimension?
- Which combinations haven't been tried?
- Which combinations seem promising?
- Are there impossible combinations we can eliminate?

## Example: New Beverage Product

| Dimension | Options |
|-----------|---------|
| Temperature | Hot, Cold, Room temp |
| Sweetness | Sweet, Unsweetened, Artificially sweetened |
| Carbonation | Sparkling, Still |
| Base | Water, Milk, Juice, Tea |
| Package | Bottle, Can, Carton, Pouch |

**Total combinations**: 3 × 3 × 2 × 4 × 4 = 288 possibilities

## Process for Exploration

1. Eliminate impossible/impractical combinations
2. Score remaining combinations on criteria
3. Identify overlooked or novel combinations
4. Select most promising for development

## Output

Morphological matrix with novel combination solutions
