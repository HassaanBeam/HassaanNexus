# Value Stream Mapping

**Purpose**: End-to-end process with waste identification

## Questions to Ask

- What are all the steps from start to finish?
- How long does each step take (process time)?
- How long does work wait between steps (wait time)?
- What percentage is value-add vs. non-value-add?
- Where are the biggest wastes?
- What's the ideal future state?

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Value-add** | Steps customer would pay for |
| **Non-value-add** | Steps that don't add value but are necessary |
| **Waste** | Steps that add no value and are unnecessary |
| **Process time** | Time actively working on item |
| **Wait time** | Time item sits between steps |
| **Lead time** | Total time from start to finish |

## The 8 Wastes (DOWNTIME)

- **D**efects: Errors requiring rework
- **O**verproduction: Making more than needed
- **W**aiting: Idle time between steps
- **N**on-utilized talent: Not using people's skills
- **T**ransportation: Unnecessary movement of materials
- **I**nventory: Excess stock or work in progress
- **M**otion: Unnecessary movement of people
- **E**xtra processing: Doing more than required

## Process

1. Select the process to map
2. Walk the process, gather data
3. Draw current state map with times
4. Calculate value-add ratio
5. Identify wastes and bottlenecks
6. Design future state map
7. Create improvement plan

## Output

Current state and future state value stream maps
