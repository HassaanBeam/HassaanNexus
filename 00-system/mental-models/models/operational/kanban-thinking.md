# Kanban Thinking

**Purpose**: Visualize work, limit WIP, optimize flow

## Core Principles

1. **Visualize the work**: Make all work visible on a board
2. **Limit Work in Progress (WIP)**: Cap items in each stage
3. **Manage flow**: Focus on moving items through, not starting new ones
4. **Make policies explicit**: Everyone knows the rules
5. **Improve collaboratively**: Continuous improvement

## Questions to Ask

- What are the stages of our workflow?
- What's currently in each stage?
- Where are the bottlenecks?
- What's our WIP limit for each stage?
- What's blocking flow?
- What's the cycle time for items?

## Basic Board Structure

```
| To Do | In Progress | Review | Done |
|-------|-------------|--------|------|
| Task1 | Task3       | Task5  | Task7|
| Task2 | Task4       |        | Task8|
```

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Lead Time** | Time from request to delivery |
| **Cycle Time** | Time from start to completion |
| **Throughput** | Items completed per time period |
| **WIP** | Current work in progress |

## WIP Limits

- Prevent multitasking
- Surface bottlenecks
- Encourage finishing over starting
- Typical: 2-3 items per person per stage

## Output

Visual board with flow metrics
