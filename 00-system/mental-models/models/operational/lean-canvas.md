# Lean Canvas

**Purpose**: One-page business model

## The Nine Blocks

| Block | Question | Fill Order |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Problem** | What are the top 3 problems? | 1 |
| **Customer Segments** | Who are the target customers? | 2 |
| **Unique Value Proposition** | What's the single, clear message? | 3 |
| **Solution** | What are the top 3 features? | 4 |
| **Channels** | How do you reach customers? | 5 |
| **Revenue Streams** | How do you make money? | 6 |
| **Cost Structure** | What are your costs? | 7 |
| **Key Metrics** | What numbers matter? | 8 |
| **Unfair Advantage** | What can't be copied? | 9 |

## Questions to Ask

- For each block: What's our answer?
- What are the riskiest assumptions?
- What should we test first?
- Does this fit on one page?

## Tips

- Fill in order (problem first, unfair advantage last)
- Be specific, not generic
- One canvas per customer segment
- Update as you learn
- Focus on riskiest assumptions

## Key Insight

The canvas isn't the goal—it's a tool for identifying and testing your riskiest assumptions quickly.

## Process

1. Draft initial canvas (30-60 min)
2. Identify riskiest assumptions
3. Prioritize what to test
4. Run experiments
5. Update canvas based on learnings
6. Repeat

## Output

One-page business model canvas
