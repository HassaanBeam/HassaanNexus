# Theory of Constraints

**Purpose**: Find and elevate the bottleneck

## Core Concept

Every system has one constraint that limits its throughput. Improving anything other than the constraint is waste.

## The Five Focusing Steps

| Step | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Identify** | Find the constraint (bottleneck) |
| 2 | **Exploit** | Get maximum output from current constraint |
| 3 | **Subordinate** | Align everything else to support the constraint |
| 4 | **Elevate** | Increase capacity of the constraint |
| 5 | **Repeat** | Find the new constraint and start over |

## Questions to Ask

- What's limiting our throughput?
- How can we get more from the current constraint?
- How are other processes affecting the constraint?
- What investment would increase constraint capacity?
- If we fix this, what becomes the next constraint?

## Identifying the Constraint

Look for:
- Longest queue/wait time
- Highest utilization
- Most frequent delays
- Where things pile up

## Exploit Before Elevate

Before investing in more capacity:
- Ensure constraint is never idle
- Remove non-essential work from constraint
- Improve quality of inputs to constraint
- Buffer the constraint from starvation

## Example

**Factory producing widgets**

1. **Identify**: Painting station is the bottleneck
2. **Exploit**: Ensure painters never wait for parts, add shifts
3. **Subordinate**: Slow down upstream to match painting capacity
4. **Elevate**: Buy another painting machine
5. **Repeat**: Now assembly is the bottleneck

## Output

Identified constraint with exploitation and elevation plan
