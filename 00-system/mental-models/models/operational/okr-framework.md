# OKR Framework

**Purpose**: Objectives and Key Results alignment

## Structure

- **Objective**: Qualitative, inspirational goal (what we want to achieve)
- **Key Results**: 3-5 quantitative measures (how we know we achieved it)

## Questions to Ask

- What's the most important thing we need to accomplish?
- How will we know we succeeded? (specific metrics)
- Are these key results measurable and time-bound?
- Are they ambitious but achievable (aim for 70% success)?
- Do they align with higher-level objectives?

## Good OKR Characteristics

**Objective**:
- Inspirational and qualitative
- Time-bound (usually quarterly)
- Actionable by the team
- Ambitious but achievable

**Key Results**:
- Specific and measurable
- Lead to objective achievement
- Difficult but possible (stretch goals)
- 3-5 per objective

## Example

**Objective**: Delight our customers with exceptional support

**Key Results**:
1. Achieve NPS score of 50+ (currently 35)
2. Reduce average response time from 24h to 4h
3. Achieve 90% first-contact resolution rate
4. Reduce support ticket volume by 20% through self-service

## Scoring

- 0.0-0.3: Failed to make progress
- 0.4-0.6: Made progress but fell short
- 0.7-1.0: Achieved (70% is considered success for stretch goals)

## Output

Clear OKRs with measurable targets
