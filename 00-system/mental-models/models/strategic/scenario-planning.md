# Scenario Planning

**Purpose**: Model multiple future states

## Questions to Ask

- What are the key uncertainties that could shape the future?
- What are 3-4 plausible future scenarios?
- What would we do differently in each scenario?
- What actions are robust across all scenarios?
- What are the early indicators of each scenario emerging?
- What's our "no regrets" move?

## Process

1. Identify key driving forces and uncertainties
2. Select 2 most impactful/uncertain axes
3. Create 2x2 matrix of scenarios
4. Name and describe each scenario
5. Develop strategic responses for each
6. Identify early warning indicators
7. Find "no regrets" moves (good in all scenarios)

## Scenario Types

- **Best case**: Everything goes right
- **Worst case**: Everything goes wrong
- **Most likely**: Expected trajectory
- **Wild card**: Unexpected disruption

## Key Principles

- Scenarios are not predictions
- Multiple scenarios, not just one
- Focus on plausible, not probable
- Use scenarios to stress-test strategy

## Output

Multiple scenarios with strategic responses
