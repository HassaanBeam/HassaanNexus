# Porter's Five Forces

**Purpose**: Analyze competitive dynamics

## The Five Forces

| Force | Question | High = Bad for Profits |
|-------|----------|------------------------|
| **Threat of New Entrants** | How easy is it to enter? | Easy entry = more competition |
| **Bargaining Power of Suppliers** | How much leverage do suppliers have? | Strong suppliers squeeze margins |
| **Bargaining Power of Buyers** | How much leverage do customers have? | Strong buyers demand lower prices |
| **Threat of Substitutes** | What alternatives exist? | Many substitutes = price pressure |
| **Industry Rivalry** | How intense is competition? | Intense rivalry = lower profits |

## Questions to Ask

- How strong is each force (1-5)?
- Which forces are most threatening?
- How can we position ourselves to reduce negative force impact?
- Where are the opportunities?

## Analysis Process

1. Rate each force (1-5 scale)
2. Identify key factors driving each force
3. Assess overall industry attractiveness
4. Find positioning to minimize threat exposure
5. Identify strategic options

## Strategic Responses

- **High entry barriers**: Invest in scale, brand, patents
- **Reduce supplier power**: Multiple suppliers, backward integration
- **Reduce buyer power**: Differentiation, switching costs
- **Block substitutes**: Innovation, bundling, switching costs
- **Manage rivalry**: Differentiation, focus, avoid price wars

## Output

Industry attractiveness assessment with strategic positioning
