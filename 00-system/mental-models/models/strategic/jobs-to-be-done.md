# Jobs to Be Done

**Purpose**: Outcome-focused needs analysis

## Core Concept

Customers don't buy products; they "hire" them to do a job. Understanding the job leads to better solutions.

## Questions to Ask

- What progress is the customer trying to make?
- What's the functional job to be done?
- What's the emotional job? Social job?
- When does this job arise? What triggers it?
- What are they currently using to do this job?
- What would make them "fire" the current solution?

## Job Dimensions

| Dimension | Focus | Example |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Functional** | Practical outcome | "Get from A to B" |
| **Emotional** | How they want to feel | "Feel safe and comfortable" |
| **Social** | How they want to be seen | "Look successful" |

## Process

1. Identify the job (not the product category)
2. Map the job timeline (before, during, after)
3. Uncover struggling moments
4. Identify current solutions (including non-consumption)
5. Find where current solutions fall short
6. Design better solutions for the job

## Example

**Wrong framing**: "I need a drill"
**JTBD framing**: "I need a hole in my wall to hang a picture"
**Better**: "I need to display family photos to feel at home"

## Output

Clear job statement with functional and emotional dimensions
