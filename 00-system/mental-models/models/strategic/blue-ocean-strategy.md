# Blue Ocean Strategy

**Purpose**: Create uncontested market space

## Core Concept

- **Red Ocean**: Existing market space, bloody competition, fight for share
- **Blue Ocean**: New market space, no competition, create demand

## The Four Actions Framework

| Action | Question |
|--------|----------|
| **Eliminate** | What factors can we eliminate that the industry takes for granted? |
| **Reduce** | What factors can we reduce well below the industry standard? |
| **Raise** | What factors can we raise well above the industry standard? |
| **Create** | What factors can we create that the industry has never offered? |

## Questions to Ask

- What factors can we ELIMINATE that the industry takes for granted?
- What factors can we REDUCE well below the standard?
- What factors can we RAISE well above the standard?
- What factors can we CREATE that the industry has never offered?
- Who are the non-customers and why?

## Process

1. Map the current strategy canvas (factors vs. offering level)
2. Apply Four Actions Framework
3. Create new strategy canvas
4. Test with non-customers
5. Execute the blue ocean move

## Key Principles

- Value innovation (not just value OR innovation)
- Focus on non-customers
- Make competition irrelevant
- Create and capture new demand

## Output

Strategy canvas showing differentiation from competition
