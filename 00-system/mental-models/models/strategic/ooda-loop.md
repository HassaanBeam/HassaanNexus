# OODA Loop

**Purpose**: Observe-Orient-Decide-Act rapid decision cycle

## The Four Stages

| Stage | Focus | Key Activities |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Observe** | Gather information | Monitor environment, collect data |
| **Orient** | Make sense of it | Analyze, interpret, update mental models |
| **Decide** | Choose action | Select best response |
| **Act** | Execute | Implement decision, observe results |

## Questions to Ask

- What are we observing in the environment?
- How should we interpret these signals?
- What are our options?
- How can we act faster than competitors?
- What feedback are we getting from our actions?

## Key Principles

- Speed matters: Faster loops = competitive advantage
- Orient is the critical phase (analysis paralysis lives here)
- The loop is continuous, not one-time
- Disrupt competitor's OODA loop

## How to Accelerate

- **Observe faster**: Better sensors, more data sources
- **Orient better**: Clear mental models, diverse perspectives
- **Decide quicker**: Pre-planned responses, delegation
- **Act immediately**: Reduce friction, empower teams

## Origin

Developed by military strategist John Boyd for air combat; now applied to business and competition.

## Output

Faster decision cycles and adaptive strategy
