# Feynman Technique

**Purpose**: Explain simply to identify gaps in understanding

## Named After

Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize-winning physicist known for explaining complex physics simply.

## Process

1. **Write the concept** at the top of a page
2. **Explain it simply** as if teaching a child (or someone with no background)
3. **Identify gaps** where you struggle or use jargon
4. **Go back to source material** to fill gaps
5. **Simplify and use analogies**
6. **Repeat** until you can explain simply

## Questions to Ask

- Can I explain this without jargon?
- Where do I get stuck?
- What analogy would make this clear?
- Could a 12-year-old understand my explanation?
- What am I glossing over?

## The Test

If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

## Why It Works

- Forces active recall (not passive re-reading)
- Exposes gaps in understanding
- Creates memorable connections
- Builds teaching ability

## Tips

- Actually write it out (don't just think about it)
- Use concrete examples
- Draw diagrams
- Avoid "basically" and hand-waving
- If you use jargon, define it

## Example

**Complex**: "Machine learning uses gradient descent to optimize a loss function."

**Feynman**: "Imagine you're lost in fog on a mountain and need to reach the valley. You feel which way is downhill and take a step. Repeat until you can't go lower. That's how AI learns—it tries something, measures how wrong it was, and adjusts in the direction of 'less wrong.'"

## Output

Simple, clear explanation revealing mastery level
