# Spaced Repetition

**Purpose**: Optimize review timing for retention

## The Principle

Review information at increasing intervals: 1 day → 3 days → 1 week → 2 weeks → 1 month → 3 months...

## Why It Works

The "forgetting curve" shows we forget rapidly after learning. Reviewing at the optimal moment (just before forgetting) strengthens memory most efficiently.

## Questions to Ask

- What do I need to remember long-term?
- When should I review this next?
- What's my current retention rate?
- Which items need more frequent review?

## The Schedule

| Review # | Interval | When |
|----------|----------|------|
| 1 | 1 day | Day after learning |
| 2 | 3 days | 3 days after review 1 |
| 3 | 1 week | 1 week after review 2 |
| 4 | 2 weeks | 2 weeks after review 3 |
| 5 | 1 month | 1 month after review 4 |
| 6 | 3 months | 3 months after review 5 |

## Implementation

- **Apps**: Anki, SuperMemo, RemNote
- **Flashcards**: Physical or digital
- **Testing**: Active recall beats passive review

## Best Practices

- Make cards atomic (one fact per card)
- Use active recall (question → answer)
- Include context and examples
- Review consistently (daily habit)
- If you fail a card, reset its interval

## Output

Review schedule optimized for retention
