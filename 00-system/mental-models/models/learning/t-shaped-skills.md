# T-Shaped Skills

**Purpose**: Balance deep expertise with broad knowledge

## The Shape

```
Breadth (horizontal bar)
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
General knowledge across many areas

                    │
                    │ Depth (vertical bar)
                    │
                    │ Deep expertise
                    │ in one area
                    ▼
```

## Questions to Ask

- What's my area of deep expertise?
- What breadth of knowledge do I have?
- What adjacent areas should I learn about?
- How do I balance depth vs. breadth?
- What T-shape does my role require?

## The Components

### Vertical Bar (Depth)
- Deep expertise in one area
- Can solve hard problems in this domain
- Recognized as expert
- Takes years to develop

### Horizontal Bar (Breadth)
- Working knowledge of many areas
- Can collaborate with specialists
- Connects dots across domains
- Easier to develop than depth

## Why T-Shape Matters

- **Collaboration**: Understand other disciplines
- **Innovation**: Connect ideas across domains
- **Flexibility**: Adapt to changing needs
- **Leadership**: See the big picture

## Variations

- **I-shaped**: Deep, no breadth (specialist)
- **Dash-shaped**: Broad, no depth (generalist)
- **T-shaped**: Deep + broad (ideal)
- **Pi-shaped**: Deep in TWO areas + broad
- **Comb-shaped**: Multiple areas of depth

## Development Strategy

1. Build depth first (establish expertise)
2. Expand breadth over time
3. Deepen adjacent areas strategically
4. Never stop learning either direction

## Output

Skill development plan balancing depth and breadth
