# Deliberate Practice

**Purpose**: Focused improvement on specific weaknesses

## What Makes Practice "Deliberate"

Not just doing the activity—specifically designed practice targeting improvement.

## Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Specific goals** | Target specific sub-skills |
| **Focus** | Full attention during practice |
| **Feedback** | Immediate, accurate feedback |
| **Stretch** | Just beyond current ability |
| **Repetition** | Many focused attempts |

## Questions to Ask

- What specific skill am I developing?
- What's my current performance level?
- What's just beyond my reach?
- How will I get feedback?
- How many focused repetitions can I do?

## Deliberate vs Regular Practice

| Regular Practice | Deliberate Practice |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Comfortable | Uncomfortable |
| General repetition | Targeted weak spots |
| Mindless/automatic | Full concentration |
| No feedback | Immediate feedback |
| Random | Structured |

## Process

1. Identify specific skill gap
2. Design practice targeting that gap
3. Practice with full concentration
4. Get immediate feedback
5. Adjust and repeat
6. Gradually increase difficulty

## Example: Improving Public Speaking

**Regular**: Give presentations when opportunities arise
**Deliberate**:
- Record yourself, identify weak moments
- Practice specifically on openings
- Get feedback from coach
- Repeat weak sections until improved

## The 10,000 Hour Myth

It's not just hours—it's hours of DELIBERATE practice that builds expertise.

## Output

Targeted practice plan with feedback loops
