# Six Thinking Hats

**Purpose**: Explore six distinct perspectives systematically

## The Six Hats

| Hat | Color | Focus | Key Question |
|-----|-------|-------|--------------|
| White | Facts | Data, information | What do we know? What's missing? |
| Red | Emotions | Feelings, intuition | What's your gut feeling? |
| Black | Caution | Risks, problems | What could go wrong? |
| Yellow | Optimism | Benefits, value | What are the benefits? |
| Green | Creativity | Ideas, alternatives | What else could we do? |
| Blue | Process | Organization, next steps | What should we do next? |

## Questions to Ask

- Let's put on the [color] hat. From this perspective, what do we see?
- Have we covered all six perspectives?
- Which perspective is being neglected?

## Process

1. Define the topic/decision
2. Go through each hat in sequence (or as needed)
3. Everyone wears the same hat at the same time
4. Capture insights from each perspective
5. Use Blue hat to synthesize and decide next steps

## Rules

- One hat at a time for the whole group
- No mixing perspectives within a hat
- All perspectives are valid
- Time-box each hat

## Output

Comprehensive multi-perspective analysis
