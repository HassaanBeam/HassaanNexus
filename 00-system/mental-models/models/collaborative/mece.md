# MECE Principle

**Purpose**: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive breakdown

## The Principle

- **Mutually Exclusive**: No overlap between categories (each item fits in exactly one place)
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: All possibilities are covered (nothing is missing)

## Questions to Ask

- Have we covered all possibilities? (Collectively Exhaustive)
- Is there any overlap between our categories? (Mutually Exclusive)
- Can any item fit into multiple categories?
- What categories are we missing?
- Is this the right level of granularity?

## Process

1. Define what you're categorizing
2. Create initial categories
3. Test for overlap (ME): Does anything fit in multiple categories?
4. Test for completeness (CE): Is anything missing?
5. Refine until both conditions are met

## Common MECE Frameworks

- **3 C's**: Company, Customers, Competitors
- **4 P's**: Product, Price, Place, Promotion
- **Internal/External**: Factors inside vs outside control
- **Past/Present/Future**: Temporal breakdown

## Anti-patterns

- Categories that overlap
- Catch-all "Other" categories (usually means incomplete thinking)
- Wrong level of granularity

## Output

Clean, non-overlapping, comprehensive categorization
