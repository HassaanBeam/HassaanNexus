# Devil's Advocate

**Purpose**: Deliberately argue the opposing position

## Questions to Ask

- What's the strongest argument AGAINST this idea?
- Why might a smart person disagree?
- What evidence would disprove our hypothesis?
- What are we ignoring because it's uncomfortable?
- If we had to argue the opposite position, what would we say?
- What would our harshest critic say?

## The Principle

Assign someone (or yourself) to deliberately argue against the prevailing view, not because they believe it, but to stress-test the idea.

## Process

1. State the idea or decision clearly
2. Assign a devil's advocate role
3. Advocate argues the opposing position as strongly as possible
4. Team defends the original position
5. Document weaknesses revealed
6. Strengthen the idea or reconsider

## Rules

- The advocate argues in good faith (strongest opposing case)
- No personal attacks
- Focus on the idea, not the people
- Thank the advocate for their service

## When to Use

- Before major decisions
- When everyone agrees too quickly
- When stakes are high
- When confirmation bias is likely

## Output

Strongest counter-arguments and weak points identified
