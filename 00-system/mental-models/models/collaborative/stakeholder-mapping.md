# Stakeholder Mapping

**Purpose**: Identify all affected parties and their interests

## Questions to Ask

- Who will benefit from this?
- Who will be negatively affected?
- Who needs to approve or provide input?
- Who will use the deliverables?
- Who has power/influence over this?
- Who has high interest but low power? High power but low interest?
- What does each stakeholder need from this?

## Power/Interest Grid

|  | Low Interest | High Interest |
|--|--------------|---------------|
| **High Power** | Keep Satisfied | Manage Closely |
| **Low Power** | Monitor | Keep Informed |

## Process

1. List all potential stakeholders
2. Assess each stakeholder's:
   - Power/influence level
   - Interest level
   - Attitude (supporter, neutral, blocker)
   - Key concerns and needs
3. Plot on Power/Interest grid
4. Define engagement strategy for each quadrant

## Stakeholder Categories

- **Primary**: Directly affected (users, customers)
- **Secondary**: Indirectly affected (partners, community)
- **Key**: Decision-makers and influencers

## Output

Stakeholder map with interests, power, and influence levels
