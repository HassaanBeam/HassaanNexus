# BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

**Purpose**: State the key point immediately

## The Structure

1. **First sentence**: The key point/request/decision
2. **Background**: Context they need
3. **Details**: Supporting information
4. **Action**: What you need from them

## Questions to Ask

- What's the bottom line?
- Can a busy person get the point from the first sentence?
- What action do I need them to take?
- What's the minimum context needed?

## Example

**Bad** (burying the lead):
"I wanted to follow up on our conversation from last week about the Henderson project. After reviewing the timeline and talking to the team, and considering the budget constraints we discussed, I think we might need to reconsider..."

**Good** (BLUF):
"I recommend delaying the Henderson project by 2 weeks.

Background: The vendor delivery slipped, and rushing would compromise quality.

Details: [specifics if they want them]

Action needed: Please approve by Friday."
