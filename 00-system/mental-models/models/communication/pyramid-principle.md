# Pyramid Principle

**Purpose**: Lead with conclusion, then support

## The Structure

```
        [Main Point]
       /     |     \
   [Support] [Support] [Support]
   /  |  \   /  |  \   /  |  \
 [Data] [Data] [Data] [Data] [Data]
```

## Process

1. **Lead with the answer** (main point first)
2. **Group supporting arguments** (3-5 points)
3. **Support each argument** with data/evidence
4. **Arrange logically** (time, structure, importance)

## Questions to Ask

- What's the ONE thing I want them to remember?
- What are my 3-5 supporting points?
- Am I leading with the conclusion?
- Can they get the key message in 30 seconds?

## Why It Works

- Busy people can stop reading anytime and still get the key point
- Readers who want detail can go deeper
- Forces you to clarify your thinking
- Makes your logic transparent

## Example

**Bad** (burying the lead):
"We analyzed market trends, customer feedback, and competitive offerings. Based on 6 months of data..."

**Good** (pyramid):
"We should launch in Q2. Here's why:
1. Market timing is optimal
2. Customer demand is validated
3. We have competitive advantage"

## Tips

- Answer "so what?" before they ask
- Use MECE for supporting arguments
- Each level should be summary of level below
- Test: Can someone skim and get the point?

## Output

Clear, top-down structured communication
