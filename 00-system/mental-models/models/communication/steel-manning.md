# Steel Manning

**Purpose**: Present the strongest version of opposing views

## The Concept

The opposite of "straw manning" (weakening an opponent's argument). Steel manning means representing the opposing view in its STRONGEST form.

## Questions to Ask

- What's the BEST version of the opposing argument?
- What evidence supports their position?
- Why might a smart, reasonable person hold this view?
- Have I represented their view fairly (would they agree)?
- What valid points does the opposition make?

## Process

1. State the opposing view
2. Find the strongest evidence FOR it
3. Present it as if you believed it
4. Test: Would the opponent say "yes, that's what I mean"?
5. Only THEN present your counter-argument

## Why Steel Manning Works

- **Builds credibility**: Shows you understand the issue
- **Strengthens your argument**: You defeat the best version, not a weak one
- **Finds truth**: Sometimes the opposition has valid points
- **Earns respect**: People feel heard and understood
- **Avoids blind spots**: Forces you to confront real challenges

## Example

**Straw man**: "They just want to cut costs, they don't care about quality."

**Steel man**: "Their position is that we can maintain 95% of quality while reducing costs 30%, which would fund two additional projects. The trade-off is accepting some non-critical defects that most users won't notice."

## Anti-Patterns

- Presenting weak versions you can easily defeat
- Ignoring valid points in opposition
- Assuming opponents are stupid or malicious

## Output

Strongest possible opposing argument, building credibility
