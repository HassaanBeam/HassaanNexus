# Situation-Complication-Resolution (SCR)

**Purpose**: Structure persuasive narratives

## The Structure

| Part | Purpose | Content |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Situation** | Establish context | What everyone agrees on, current state |
| **Complication** | Create tension | The problem, change, or challenge |
| **Resolution** | Provide solution | What we should do about it |

## Questions to Ask

- What's the current situation they'll recognize?
- What's the complication that demands action?
- What's the resolution I'm proposing?
- Does this flow logically and persuasively?

## Example

**Situation**: "Our customer support team has grown from 5 to 25 people over the past year, handling 10x the ticket volume."

**Complication**: "But our tools haven't scaled. Agents spend 40% of their time on manual tasks that could be automated, leading to burnout and 30% annual turnover."

**Resolution**: "I propose we implement a modern helpdesk platform. Investment: $50K. Expected ROI: $200K annually in productivity gains and reduced turnover."

## Why SCR Works

- **Situation** builds agreement (they nod along)
- **Complication** creates urgency (something must change)
- **Resolution** provides relief (here's the answer)

## Variations

- **SCQA**: Situation, Complication, Question, Answer
- **Problem-Solution**: Simplified for clear problems
- **Before-After-Bridge**: Paint the contrast

## Tips

- Keep Situation brief—move to Complication quickly
- Make Complication feel urgent
- Resolution should directly address the Complication

## Output

Compelling narrative structure for proposals
