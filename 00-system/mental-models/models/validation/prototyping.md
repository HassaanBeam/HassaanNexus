# Prototyping

**Purpose**: Build testable representations for validation

## Types of Prototypes

| Type | Fidelity | Speed | Best For |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Paper/Sketch** | Low | Hours | Early concepts, flow |
| **Clickable mockup** | Medium | Days | UI/UX testing |
| **Wizard of Oz** | Medium | Days | Testing feasibility |
| **Concierge** | High | Weeks | Full experience, manual |
| **MVP** | High | Weeks | Market validation |

## Questions to Ask

- What's the core assumption we're testing?
- What's the simplest prototype that tests it?
- What feedback do we need?
- How quickly can we build this?
- What will we do with positive/negative results?

## Prototype Selection

**Use Paper/Sketch when**:
- Testing basic concepts
- Very early stage
- Need quick iteration

**Use Clickable Mockup when**:
- Testing user interface
- Need realistic feel
- Preparing for development

**Use Wizard of Oz when**:
- Testing complex features
- Building tech isn't feasible yet
- Human can simulate the system

**Use MVP when**:
- Validating market demand
- Testing with real customers
- Need actual transactions

## Process

1. Identify key assumption to test
2. Choose appropriate prototype type
3. Build quickly (hours to days)
4. Test with real users
5. Gather feedback
6. Iterate or pivot

## Output

Prototype with user feedback and learnings
