# Hypothesis Testing

**Purpose**: Scientific method for decision-making

## Structure

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Hypothesis** | Clear, falsifiable statement | "Adding reviews will increase conversion" |
| **Prediction** | What we expect to observe if true | "Conversion rate will increase by 10%" |
| **Experiment** | How we'll test it | "A/B test with reviews on product pages" |
| **Criteria** | What result confirms/rejects | "Statistically significant increase of 5%+" |

## Questions to Ask

- What do we believe to be true?
- What would we expect to see if it's true?
- How can we test this quickly and cheaply?
- What result would change our mind?
- What's the minimum sample size needed?

## Good Hypothesis Characteristics

- **Specific**: Clear what you're testing
- **Measurable**: Can observe results
- **Falsifiable**: Possible to prove wrong
- **Actionable**: Results lead to decisions

## Process

1. State the hypothesis clearly
2. Define success criteria BEFORE testing
3. Design minimum viable test
4. Run the test with sufficient sample
5. Analyze results objectively
6. Accept or reject hypothesis
7. Document learnings

## Common Pitfalls

- Changing hypothesis after seeing results
- Insufficient sample size
- Not defining success criteria upfront
- Confirmation bias in interpretation

## Output

Validated or invalidated hypothesis with learnings
