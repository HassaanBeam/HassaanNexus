# Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)

**Purpose**: Visual cause-effect analysis across dimensions

## Standard Categories (6 M's)

| Category | Focus | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Man** | People | Skills, training, staffing, fatigue |
| **Machine** | Equipment | Tools, technology, maintenance |
| **Method** | Process | Procedures, policies, workflows |
| **Material** | Inputs | Data quality, resources, supplies |
| **Measurement** | Metrics | KPIs, feedback, monitoring |
| **Mother Nature** | Environment | External factors, market, weather |

## Questions to Ask

- For each category: What factors here could cause this problem?
- Which causes are most likely?
- Which causes can we control?
- Are there causes we haven't considered?

## Process

1. Write the problem (effect) at the "head" of the fish
2. Draw the spine and major bones (categories)
3. Brainstorm causes for each category
4. Add sub-causes as smaller bones
5. Analyze which causes are most likely/impactful
6. Investigate top causes

## Alternative Categories

- **4 P's**: Policies, Procedures, People, Plant
- **4 S's**: Surroundings, Suppliers, Systems, Skills
- Custom categories based on your context

## Output

Visual diagram of all potential causes by category
