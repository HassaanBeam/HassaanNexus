# Force Field Analysis

**Purpose**: Map driving and restraining forces

## The Concept

Any situation is held in balance by forces pushing for change (driving) and forces resisting change (restraining). To create change, either strengthen driving forces or weaken restraining forces.

## Questions to Ask

- What forces are DRIVING us toward the goal?
- What forces are RESTRAINING us from the goal?
- How strong is each force (1-5)?
- Which restraining forces can we reduce?
- Which driving forces can we strengthen?
- What would tip the balance?

## Process

1. Define the desired change/goal
2. Draw a line representing the current equilibrium
3. List driving forces on one side (with strength ratings)
4. List restraining forces on the other side (with strength ratings)
5. Analyze: What can we change?
6. Prioritize actions

## Strategies

- **Strengthen drivers**: Add resources, motivation, incentives
- **Weaken restrainers**: Remove obstacles, address concerns, provide training
- Often weakening restrainers is more effective than strengthening drivers

## Example

**Goal**: Adopt new software

**Driving Forces**: Better features (4), Management support (3), Competitor pressure (3)

**Restraining Forces**: Learning curve (5), Fear of change (4), Time investment (3)
