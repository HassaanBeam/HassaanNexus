# Socratic Questioning

## Purpose
Test assumptions, clarify reasoning, and uncover gaps in thinking through systematic questioning. Named after Socrates' method of inquiry.

## Core Question Types

### 1. Clarification Questions
**Purpose:** Ensure clear understanding

**Questions to Ask:**
- What exactly do you mean by [term]?
- Can you give me an example of that?
- How does this relate to [related concept]?
- Could you rephrase that in different words?

---

### 2. Assumption Probing
**Purpose:** Uncover hidden assumptions

**Questions to Ask:**
- What are you assuming about [aspect]?
- Why do you think this is true?
- What evidence supports this assumption?
- What if this assumption is wrong?
- Is this assumption critical to the approach?

---

### 3. Evidence and Reasoning
**Purpose:** Test the logic and data

**Questions to Ask:**
- What evidence supports this approach?
- How do you know this will work?
- Have you seen this succeed before?
- What data backs up this claim?
- Are there counterexamples?

---

### 4. Alternative Perspectives
**Purpose:** Consider other viewpoints

**Questions to Ask:**
- What would [stakeholder] say about this?
- How else could we approach this problem?
- What are we not considering?
- What's the opposite viewpoint?

---

### 5. Implications and Consequences
**Purpose:** Think through outcomes

**Questions to Ask:**
- What happens if this succeeds?
- What happens if this fails?
- What are the unintended consequences?
- How does this affect [related system]?
- What comes after this?

---

### 6. Meta-Questions
**Purpose:** Question the question

**Questions to Ask:**
- Why is this question important?
- What question should we be asking instead?
- Are we solving the right problem?
- What's the root cause we're addressing?

## Example Application

**Project:** Lead Qualification Workflow

**Clarification:**
- "What exactly do you mean by 'qualified lead'?"
- "Can you give an example of a qualified vs unqualified lead?"

**Assumption Probing:**
- "You're assuming AI can match human judgment - what evidence supports this?"
- "What if sales team doesn't trust AI-generated scores?"

**Evidence:**
- "How do you know 30 minutes per lead is accurate?"
- "What data shows manual qualification is the bottleneck?"

**Alternatives:**
- "Could we improve the manual process instead of automating?"
- "What if we augment humans rather than replace them?"

**Implications:**
- "If this works, how many leads can we process per day?"
- "What happens to sales team's workflow when this goes live?"

**Meta:**
- "Are we solving lead qualification, or sales team capacity?"
- "Is speed the real problem, or is it lead quality?"

**Remember:** Socratic questioning is not about having answers - it's about asking better questions to reveal truth!
