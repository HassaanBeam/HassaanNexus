# SWOT Analysis

## Purpose
Systematically evaluate internal capabilities (Strengths/Weaknesses) and external environment (Opportunities/Threats) to inform strategic decisions and identify leverage points.

## The SWOT Framework

```
                INTERNAL (What you control)
                         │
    STRENGTHS            │            WEAKNESSES
    ─────────────────────┼─────────────────────
    (Leverage these)     │      (Shore these up)
                         │

## The Four Quadrants

### Strengths (Internal + Positive)
**What you do well. Advantages you have.**

**Questions to Ask:**
- What do we do better than anyone else?
- What unique resources do we have?
- What do customers love about us?
- What competitive advantages exist?
- What internal capabilities are strong?

**Examples - Lead Qualification:**
- Strong AI/ML team (technical expertise)
- Existing CRM integration framework (reusable code)
- VP Sales is tech-savvy (executive support)
- Clean customer data (good foundation)
- Sales team trusts product team (relationship)

---

### Weaknesses (Internal + Negative)
**What you lack. Disadvantages you face.**

**Questions to Ask:**
- What do we do poorly?
- What resources do we lack?
- What do customers complain about?
- Where do competitors beat us?
- What internal limitations exist?

**Examples - Lead Qualification:**
- No AI explainability experience (skill gap)
- Legacy CRM system (technical constraint)
- Sales team skeptical of AI (adoption risk)
- Small product team (resource constraint)
- No prior lead scoring system (no baseline)

---

### Opportunities (External + Positive)
**External factors you can exploit for advantage.**

**Questions to Ask:**
- What market trends favor us?
- What problems are customers facing?
- What technology enables new approaches?
- What gaps do competitors have?
- What regulations/changes create openings?

**Examples - Lead Qualification:**
- Competitors have poor AI scoring (market gap)
- GPT-4 API now available (technology enabler)
- Sales hiring freeze (need efficiency)
- LinkedIn enrichment API launched (data source)
- Industry moving to AI-assisted sales (trend)

---

### Threats (External + Negative)
**External factors that could harm you.**

**Questions to Ask:**
- What obstacles do we face?
- What are competitors doing?
- What technology could disrupt us?
- What regulations could limit us?
- What market changes could hurt us?

**Examples - Lead Qualification:**
- Competitor launching AI scoring next month (competitive threat)
- LinkedIn may restrict API access (dependency risk)
- Sales hiring freeze might be lifted (reduces urgency)
- GDPR restricts data enrichment (regulatory threat)
- AI hype fatigue in sales org (cultural threat)

---

## The SWOT Matrix - Strategy Formation

Once you've identified all four quadrants, combine them strategically:

### SO Strategy: Leverage Strengths to Capture Opportunities
**Pattern:** Use what you're good at to exploit favorable conditions

**Example - Lead Qualification:**
- **Strength:** Strong AI team
- **Opportunity:** GPT-4 API available
- **SO Strategy:** Build advanced AI scoring using GPT-4 (leverage expertise + new tech)

---

### ST Strategy: Use Strengths to Defend Against Threats
**Pattern:** Deploy advantages to mitigate external risks

**Example:**
- **Strength:** VP Sales is tech-savvy
- **Threat:** Sales team skeptical of AI
- **ST Strategy:** Have VP champion AI internally (use exec support to overcome resistance)

---

### WO Strategy: Address Weaknesses to Capture Opportunities
**Pattern:** Fix gaps to take advantage of openings

**Example:**
- **Weakness:** No AI explainability experience
- **Opportunity:** Competitors have poor explainability
- **WO Strategy:** Partner with AI vendor for explainability tech (fix gap + differentiate)

---

### WT Strategy: Minimize Weaknesses and Avoid Threats
**Pattern:** Defensive positioning, reduce exposure

**Example:**
- **Weakness:** Small product team
- **Threat:** Competitor launching soon
- **WT Strategy:** Build MVP only (scope down to ship before competitor)

---

## SWOT Analysis Process

### Step 1: Brainstorm Each Quadrant (Silent)
**Time:** 5 minutes per quadrant
**Instructions:**
- Work individually first (avoid groupthink)
- Be specific (not "good team" but "AI engineer with 10 years NLP experience")
- Focus on relevant factors (not everything, just what impacts this project)

### Step 2: Share and Cluster
**Time:** 10 minutes per quadrant
**Instructions:**
- Each person shares items
- Group similar items
- Vote on most important (top 3-5 per quadrant)

### Step 3: Form Strategies
**Time:** 15 minutes
**Instructions:**
- Fill in the strategy matrix (SO, ST, WO, WT)
- For each combination, ask: "How can we use [S/W] to address [O/T]?"
- Prioritize strategies (which are highest leverage?)

### Step 4: Action Planning
**Time:** 10 minutes
**Instructions:**
- Convert strategies to actions
- Assign owners
- Set deadlines

## SWOT for Different Contexts

### Go/No-Go Decision
**Use SWOT to decide:** Should we do this project?

**Decision Framework:**
- **GO:** Strengths + Opportunities > Weaknesses + Threats
- **NO-GO:** Weaknesses + Threats > Strengths + Opportunities
- **CONDITIONAL:** Need to address critical weaknesses first

**Example:**
```
Strengths: 5 strong factors
Opportunities: 5 favorable factors
Weaknesses: 5 gaps
Threats: 5 risks

Analysis:
- Critical Strength: AI team expertise (can build this)
- Critical Threat: Competitor in 2 months (time pressure)
- Critical Weakness: Small team (resource constraint)

Decision: GO (with MVP scope to ship before competitor)
```

---

### Competitive Positioning
**Use SWOT to find:** How to beat competitors?

**Framework:**
- Our Strengths + Their Weaknesses = Attack here
- Our Weaknesses + Their Strengths = Avoid or defend

**Example:**
```
Our Strength: Explainability
Their Weakness: Black-box AI

Strategy: Position as "trustworthy AI" (attack their weakness)

Our Weakness: Speed (small team)
Their Strength: Fast shipping

Strategy: Partner for speed (vendor API) or focus on quality over speed
```

---

### Risk Mitigation
**Use SWOT to identify:** What could go wrong?

**Pattern:**
- Weaknesses + Threats = High-risk combinations
- Strengths = Risk mitigations

**Example:**
```
High Risk: Small team (W) + Competitor launching (T) = Lose timing advantage
Mitigation: MVP scope (use exec support strength to get approval for cuts)

High Risk: No explainability (W) + AI skepticism (T) = Adoption failure
Mitigation: Partner with vendor (leverage AI team strength to integrate quickly)
```

---

## Common SWOT Mistakes

### 1. Confusing Internal vs External
❌ "Threat: Our team is small" (that's internal = Weakness)
❌ "Strength: Market growing" (that's external = Opportunity)

✅ **Internal (you control):** Strengths, Weaknesses
✅ **External (environment):** Opportunities, Threats

---

### 2. Being Too Generic
❌ "Strength: Good team"
✅ "Strength: AI engineer with 10 years NLP experience at Google"

❌ "Weakness: Limited resources"
✅ "Weakness: Only 2 engineers available, both part-time on this project"

---

### 3. Listing Everything
❌ SWOT with 30 items per quadrant (analysis paralysis)
✅ SWOT with 3-5 critical items per quadrant (actionable)

**Rule:** If it doesn't significantly impact the project, leave it out.

---

### 4. No Strategy Formation
❌ Just listing S/W/O/T and stopping
✅ Using combinations (SO, ST, WO, WT) to form strategies

**Remember:** SWOT without strategy is just brainstorming.

---

### 5. One-Time Analysis
❌ Do SWOT once at start, never revisit
✅ Update SWOT as environment changes

**Example:**
- Month 1: Competitor is threat
- Month 3: Competitor launched, got bad reviews → Now opportunity
- Update SWOT, adjust strategy

---

## When to Use

**Best For:**
- ✅ Strategic planning (where to focus)
- ✅ Go/No-Go decisions (should we build this)
- ✅ Competitive analysis (how to position)
- ✅ Risk assessment (what could go wrong)
- ✅ Resource allocation (where to invest)
- ✅ Project kickoff (understand landscape)

**Not Ideal For:**
- ❌ Tactical execution (too high-level)
- ❌ Very early exploration (don't know enough yet)
- ❌ Simple, low-stakes projects (overkill)
- ❌ When environment is stable and well-understood

**Best Timing:**
- ✅ Project kickoff (understand landscape)
- ✅ Major pivots (reassess situation)
- ✅ Quarterly reviews (update strategy)
- ✅ Before big decisions (go/no-go, resource allocation)

**Combines Well With:**
- **Pre-Mortem** - Threats become failure scenarios
- **Stakeholder Mapping** - Stakeholders are opportunities/threats
- **Pareto Principle** - Focus on vital few S/W/O/T
- **Design Thinking** - Opportunities = user needs to solve

## Quick SWOT (10 Minutes)

**Fast version for simple projects:**

1. **Set timer: 2 min per quadrant**
2. **Brainstorm individually** (post-its or list)
3. **Share top 2-3 per quadrant**
4. **Form 1-2 strategies** (highest leverage combinations)
5. **Decide action** (what to do differently based on SWOT)

**Example:**
```
S: AI team, exec support
W: Small team, no explainability
O: GPT-4 API, competitor gap
T: Competitor launching soon, API risk

Top Strategy: SO - Leverage AI team + GPT-4 to build explainable scoring
Action: Start GPT-4 prototype this week (before competitor ships)
```
