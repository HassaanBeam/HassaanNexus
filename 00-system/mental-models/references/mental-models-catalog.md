## Purpose

This guide provides mental models to elicit comprehensive project requirements, design, and task breakdowns through collaborative questioning. Use these to guide users through thoughtful project planning.

**KEY PRINCIPLE**: Let the user PICK the mental model(s) they want to use. Don't just select for them!

---

## How to Use This Guide (IMPORTANT!)

### Step 1: Offer Mental Models to User

After understanding the project basics, ALWAYS offer 2-3 relevant mental models and let the user pick:

**Example**:
```
Now let's dive into requirements. I have a few approaches we could use to
think through this comprehensively:

1. **First Principles**: Break down the problem to its fundamentals
   - Best for: Novel projects, challenging assumptions, getting to the core

2. **Stakeholder Mapping**: Identify everyone affected and their needs
   - Best for: Projects with multiple parties, organizational work

3. **SWOT Analysis**: Analyze strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats
   - Best for: Strategic projects, competitive situations

Which approach sounds most useful for your project? Or we could combine them!
```

### Step 2: User Picks

User responds with their choice (e.g., "Let's do First Principles and Stakeholder Mapping")

### Step 3: Apply the Questions

Use the questions from the selected mental model(s) to guide the elicitation conversation.

### Step 4: Adapt as Needed

If the chosen model isn't yielding good insights, offer to switch: "This model isn't quite clicking. Want to try [Alternative Model] instead?"

---

## Golden Rule

🎯 **ALWAYS offer options. NEVER just select and use a mental model without user input!**

The user should feel in control of how we approach the planning. We're guides, not dictators!

## Elicitation Question Templates

### Opening Questions (All Phases)
- "Tell me more about [topic]..."
- "What's most important to you about [aspect]?"
- "What concerns you most about [area]?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would [outcome] look like?"

### Clarifying Questions
- "Can you give me an example of that?"
- "What would success look like specifically?"
- "How would you know if this is working?"
- "What does [term] mean in your context?"

### Deepening Questions
- "Why is that important?"
- "What would happen if we didn't do that?"
- "What else should I know about [topic]?"
- "What am I not asking that I should be?"

### Constraint Questions
- "What's non-negotiable?"
- "What trade-offs are you willing to make?"
- "What's the timeline/budget/resource constraint?"
- "What dependencies exist?"

---

## Collaborative Writing Process

### Step 1: Elicit (Don't Prescribe)
- Ask questions based on selected mental models
- Listen to user's responses
- Probe deeper on unclear areas
- Summarize understanding

### Step 2: Draft Together
- "Based on what you've told me, here's a draft of [section]..."
- Present draft clearly
- Explicitly ask for feedback: "Does this capture it?"
- Note: You're writing WITH the user, not FOR the user

### Step 3: Iterate
- Make changes based on feedback
- Ask clarifying questions on changes
- Present updated version
- Repeat until user confirms: "This looks good!"

### Step 4: Confirm Explicitly
- "Are you happy with this [requirements/design/tasks]?"
- "Anything else to add or change?"
- "Should we move to the next section?"

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT proceed to next document until user explicitly confirms!

---

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

❌ **Don't**: Generate full document without user input
✅ **Do**: Ask questions, build collaboratively

❌ **Don't**: Assume you know what user wants
✅ **Do**: Validate understanding at each step

❌ **Don't**: Skip the pause/review step
✅ **Do**: Always pause, always get explicit confirmation

❌ **Don't**: Use jargon or complex frameworks without explaining
✅ **Do**: Use simple language, explain mental models briefly

❌ **Don't**: Make it feel like an interrogation
✅ **Do**: Make it feel like a collaborative design session

## Example Elicitation Flow

### For Requirements.md (Using First Principles + Stakeholder Mapping)

**AI**: "Let's start with requirements. I'll use first principles thinking to help us get to the core of what you need. First, can you tell me: what's the absolute core problem you're trying to solve with this project?"

**User**: "I need to organize my client proposals better."

**AI**: "Got it. If we stripped away all assumptions about how proposals are currently done, what are the fundamental requirements? What MUST happen?"

**User**: "I need to track which clients I've sent proposals to, what stage they're in, and follow up appropriately."

**AI**: "Perfect. Now let's think about stakeholders. Who will use this system besides you?"

**User**: "Just me, but my business partner might need to see status updates."

**AI**: "Understood. What does your business partner need to see specifically?"

**User**: "Just high-level: which proposals are pending, which are won, which are lost."

**AI**: "Great. Based on this, here's a draft of the requirements section:

[Presents draft requirements]

Does this capture everything? Anything to add or change?"

**User**: "Looks good, but I also need to store the actual proposal files."

**AI**: "Excellent point. Let me add that. Here's the updated version:

[Shows update]

How's this now?"

**User**: "Perfect!"

**AI**: "Wonderful! Since you confirmed this looks good, let's move to design.md where we'll figure out HOW to build this system..."

---

**Remember**: Mental models are tools to guide questions, not rigid processes. Adapt based on project type, user expertise, and context. The goal is collaborative design, not procedural compliance!
