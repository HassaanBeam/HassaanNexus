# Mental Models Framework

**Purpose**: System-level catalog of thinking frameworks for collaborative work across all skills and projects.

**When to Use**:
- **Requirements gathering**: Stakeholder mapping, first principles, SWOT
- **Design decisions**: Systems thinking, decision matrix, pre-mortem
- **Risk analysis**: Pre-mortem, force field analysis, red team
- **Problem decomposition**: Root cause (5 Whys), fishbone, MECE
- **Strategic planning**: Scenario planning, OKR, blue ocean
- **Creative ideation**: Design thinking, SCAMPER, lateral thinking

---

## Quick Reference

**What This Skill Provides**:
- ✅ **59 mental models** across 12 categories
- ✅ **Selection guidance** - Which model for which situation
- ✅ **Question templates** - Ready-to-use elicitation questions
- ✅ **Progressive disclosure** - Reference specific models as needed
- ✅ **User choice** - Always offer options, never prescribe
- ✅ **Cross-skill reusability** - Works with create-project, execute-project, create-skill, etc.

## Core Principle: Offer Mental Models Proactively

🎯 **GOLDEN RULE**: AI always loads mental-models skill to see what's available, then offers 2-3 relevant models to the user.

**Usage Pattern**:
1. **AI loads mental-models skill** at appropriate decision points
2. **AI reviews catalog** to identify 2-3 relevant models for current context
3. **AI offers models** with descriptive but efficient metadata
4. **User picks** which model(s) to apply
5. **AI loads detailed reference** and applies selected model questions

**Example**:
```
Now let's think through this comprehensively. I've reviewed the mental models catalog and recommend:

1. **First Principles** – Strip assumptions, find fundamental truths
   Best for: Novel projects, challenging assumptions

2. **Stakeholder Mapping** – Identify all affected parties and interests
   Best for: Multi-party projects, organizational work

3. **Pre-Mortem** – Imagine failure modes before implementation
   Best for: High-stakes projects, risk mitigation

Which approach sounds most useful? Or we could combine them!
```

**Pattern**:
- ✅ AI loads this skill automatically at decision points
- ✅ AI offers relevant models with brief, efficient descriptions
- ✅ User chooses which model(s) to apply
- ✅ AI loads detailed reference files only after user selection

**Never**: "I'll use First Principles thinking..." (prescriptive)
**Always**: "I've identified 3 relevant models. Which would you like to use?" (collaborative)

---

## Metadata Format: Descriptive but Efficient

When offering mental models, use this concise format:

**Format**: `**Model Name** – Core action/outcome (3-7 words)`

**Examples**:
- ✅ `**First Principles** – Strip assumptions, find fundamental truths`
- ✅ `**Pre-Mortem** – Imagine failure modes before implementation`
- ✅ `**Stakeholder Mapping** – Identify all affected parties and interests`
- ❌ `**First Principles** – This is a thinking framework where you break down complex problems to their most fundamental truths by stripping away all assumptions...` (too verbose)
- ❌ `**Pre-Mortem** – Failure analysis` (too brief, not descriptive enough)

**Best for**: Add only when context matters (1 line, 5-10 words)
- Example: `Best for: Novel projects, challenging assumptions`
- Example: `Best for: High-stakes projects, risk mitigation`

**Principle**: User should understand what the model does and when to use it from 1-2 lines, not paragraphs.

## Progressive Disclosure Pattern

**Keep SKILL.md lean** - Reference detailed models only when needed:

### Pattern 1: Light Reference (Recommended)
```markdown
# In execute-project SKILL.md

## Step 4: Execute with Mental Models (Optional)

Want to apply structured thinking? Load specific models from mental-models skill:

- **Risk analysis**: See mental-models/references/diagnostic-models.md → Pre-Mortem
- **Decision-making**: See mental-models/references/analytical-models.md → Decision Matrix
- **Requirements**: See mental-models/references/cognitive-models.md → First Principles

[Only load if user wants structured approach]
```

### Pattern 2: Full Integration
```markdown
# In create-project SKILL.md

## Step 6: Collaborative Planning

Offer mental models from mental-models skill:
1. Load: mental-models/SKILL.md (categories overview)
2. User picks category
3. Load: mental-models/references/{category}-models.md
4. Apply selected model questions
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Avoid duplicating 500+ lines across skills
- ✅ Load only when user wants structured thinking
- ✅ Single source of truth for model updates
- ✅ Reusable across all skills

## Integration Examples

### Example 1: execute-project Integration

**In execute-project/SKILL.md**:
```markdown
## Step 4D: Section Completion Checkpoint (Optional Mental Models)

Before bulk-completing this section, want to apply structured thinking?

Options:
1. Continue without mental models (faster)
2. Apply Pre-Mortem to check for risks
3. Apply Systems Thinking to validate dependencies

If user chooses 2 or 3:
→ Load: mental-models/references/diagnostic-models.md (Pre-Mortem)
→ Load: mental-models/references/cognitive-models.md (Systems Thinking)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Optional (doesn't slow down execution)
- ✅ Contextual (offered at decision points)
- ✅ Progressive (only loads if user wants)

---

### Example 2: create-project Integration

**In create-project/SKILL.md**:
```markdown
## Step 7: Load plan.md → Apply Mental Models

Before filling plan.md, offer mental models from mental-models skill:

1. Load: mental-models/SKILL.md (show categories)
2. User picks 1-2 models
3. Load specific reference file
4. Apply questions from selected models
5. Fill plan.md collaboratively
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Single source of truth (mental-models.md)
- ✅ No duplication in create-project
- ✅ Easy updates (change mental-models, all skills benefit)

---

### Example 3: create-skill Integration

**In create-skill/SKILL.md**:
```markdown
## Step 2: Understanding the Skill (Optional Mental Models)

Want to use structured thinking to understand skill requirements?

Load: mental-models/references/requirements-models.md

Recommended: First Principles, Stakeholder Mapping
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Applies to skill design
- ✅ Reuses existing catalog
- ✅ Optional enhancement

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Don't**: Select a mental model without offering choice
✅ **Do**: Present 2-3 options and let user pick

❌ **Don't**: Load full catalog into every skill
✅ **Do**: Reference mental-models skill via progressive disclosure

❌ **Don't**: Use jargon without explaining
✅ **Do**: Explain each model briefly when offering

❌ **Don't**: Make it feel like an interrogation
✅ **Do**: Make it collaborative and conversational

❌ **Don't**: Duplicate mental-models.md content in other skills
✅ **Do**: Reference this skill as single source of truth

---

## Success Criteria

**This skill succeeds when**:
- ✅ Users understand which model fits their situation
- ✅ Questions elicit comprehensive thinking
- ✅ Collaboration feels natural, not procedural
- ✅ Other skills can reference without duplication
- ✅ Progressive disclosure prevents context bloat

---

## Version History

**v1.0** (2025-01-22):
- Extracted from create-project skill
- Reorganized for cross-skill reusability
- Added progressive disclosure patterns
- Created use-case and category reference files
- Established user-choice principle
