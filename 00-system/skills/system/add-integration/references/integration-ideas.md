## Security Considerations

### When to Integrate

**Good Security Posture** ✅:
- Tool has robust API security
- You control the credentials
- Can use read-only access
- Can revoke access easily
- Tool supports token rotation

**Exercise Caution** ⚠️:
- Tool requires broad permissions
- Can't limit scope sufficiently
- Credential management unclear
- No audit logging
- Difficult to revoke access

### Best Practices

1. **Minimal Permissions**
   - Start with read-only
   - Add write when needed
   - Never grant more than necessary

2. **Credential Rotation**
   - Rotate every 3-6 months
   - Document rotation schedule
   - Set calendar reminders

3. **Audit Regularly**
   - Review active integrations monthly
   - Remove unused integrations
   - Check for suspicious activity

4. **Document Everything**
   - What integration does
   - What permissions granted
   - When credentials expire
   - How to regenerate

5. **Backup Credentials**
   - Use password manager
   - Never commit to git
   - Keep recovery info secure

## Integration Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks

- [ ] Test each integration (basic functionality)
- [ ] Check for tool API updates
- [ ] Review error logs (if any)
- [ ] Verify credentials not expiring soon
- [ ] Update documentation if anything changed

### Quarterly Tasks

- [ ] Rotate API keys (security best practice)
- [ ] Review integration usage (still valuable?)
- [ ] Check for new MCP servers (better alternatives?)
- [ ] Update MCP servers (npx handles this, but verify)
- [ ] Clean up unused integrations

### Yearly Tasks

- [ ] Full security audit
- [ ] Evaluate ROI of each integration
- [ ] Research new integration opportunities
- [ ] Update integration documentation
- [ ] Share learnings with team

## Getting Creative

**Remember**: MCP is a protocol, not just pre-built integrations.

**You can**:
- Build custom MCP servers
- Chain integrations together
- Create unique workflows
- Automate your specific processes
- Extend Nexus in ways we haven't imagined

**Examples**:
- Query your smart home data
- Integrate with proprietary internal tools
- Connect to hardware devices
- Build domain-specific analyzers
- Create custom reporting pipelines

**The limit is your creativity!**

**Start Simple**: Pick one integration that solves a real problem. Get comfortable with it. Then add more as needs arise. Don't integrate for integration's sake—integrate for value!
