## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is like a universal adapter that lets Claude interact with external tools and data sources. Think of it as building bridges between Nexus and the tools you already use.

### The Problem MCP Solves

Without MCP, Claude can only work with:
- Information in this conversation
- Files you explicitly share
- General knowledge from training

**With MCP, Claude can:**
- Read/write to external tools directly
- Access live data from services
- Interact with APIs on your behalf
- Sync information bidirectionally

### Real-World Analogy

Imagine Claude is your personal assistant:

**Without MCP**: You manually copy-paste between Claude and other tools
- You: "Let me check GitHub for open issues..."
- *[Opens browser, navigates to GitHub, copies issue list]*
- You: "Here are the issues: [paste]"
- Claude: *[Processes pasted data]*

**With MCP**: Claude accesses tools directly
- You: "Show me open GitHub issues"
- Claude: *[Connects to GitHub via MCP, fetches issues]*
- Claude: "Here are your 5 open issues: [live data]"

## How MCP Works

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
│   Claude    │◄─────►│ MCP Server  │◄─────►│   Tool API  │
│  (Nexus)    │       │  (Bridge)   │       │  (GitHub)   │
└─────────────┘       └─────────────┘       └─────────────┘
```

**Components**:
1. **Claude** - Sends requests for tool actions
2. **MCP Server** - Translates between Claude and the tool
3. **Tool API** - The external service (GitHub, Slack, etc.)

### Setup Process

1. **Install MCP Server** - Small program that bridges Claude ↔ Tool
2. **Configure Credentials** - API keys so the server can authenticate
3. **Claude Connects** - On startup, Claude loads configured MCP servers
4. **Use Naturally** - Just ask Claude to interact with the tool

## Example Use Cases in Nexus

### 1. Project Management Sync

**Setup**: GitHub + Linear integration

**Workflow**:
```
User: "Start new project for website redesign"
→ Nexus creates project structure
→ Claude creates GitHub repo
→ Claude creates Linear project
→ Links maintained automatically
```

### 2. Communication Automation

**Setup**: Slack integration

**Workflow**:
```
User: "I'm done for the day"
→ close-session triggers
→ Generates session summary
→ Posts to Slack #daily-updates channel
→ Team stays informed automatically
```

### 3. Knowledge Base Sync

**Setup**: Obsidian integration

**Workflow**:
```
User: "Document this workflow"
→ Creates skill in Nexus
→ Syncs to Obsidian vault
→ Accessible via Obsidian graph
→ Searchable across all notes
```

### 4. Data-Driven Decisions

**Setup**: PostgreSQL integration

**Workflow**:
```
User: "Analyze sales trends for Q4"
→ Claude queries production database
→ Generates analysis from real data
→ Creates visualizations
→ Saves report to Google Drive
```

### 5. Automated Backups

**Setup**: Google Drive integration

**Workflow**:
```
close-session skill enhanced:
→ Backs up Memory/ to Drive
→ Archives project outputs
→ Creates dated snapshots
→ Never lose context
```

## Benefits of Using MCP

### For You

1. **Less Manual Work**
   - No more copy-pasting between tools
   - Automated data flow
   - Reduced context switching

2. **Live Data Access**
   - Always current information
   - No stale data
   - Real-time verification

3. **Workflow Integration**
   - Nexus becomes central hub
   - Tools work together seamlessly
   - One interface for everything

4. **Knowledge Preservation**
   - Sync to multiple systems
   - Redundant backups
   - Cross-platform accessibility

### For Nexus

1. **Extensibility**
   - Add capabilities without modifying core
   - Community-driven integrations
   - Future-proof architecture

2. **Flexibility**
   - Use tools you already know
   - Choose your own stack
   - Mix and match as needed

3. **Security**
   - Credentials stay on your machine
   - No third-party servers
   - You control access

## When to Add Integrations

### Good Reasons ✅

- **Frequent Copy-Pasting**: You regularly move data between tools
- **Team Collaboration**: Need to share Nexus outputs externally
- **Data Validation**: Want to verify against live sources
- **Workflow Automation**: Repetitive cross-tool tasks
- **Knowledge Sync**: Maintain single source of truth across platforms

### Maybe Not Yet ⚠️

- **One-Time Use**: You'll only use it once
- **Learning Curve**: Adding complexity you don't need yet
- **Setup Overhead**: Configuration time > time saved
- **Security Concerns**: Uncertain about credential safety
- **Nexus Working Well**: Current workflow is already smooth

### Remember

**Integrations are powerful but optional.**

Nexus works perfectly standalone. Add integrations only when they solve a real problem or save significant time.

Start with one integration (GitHub or Slack are good first choices), learn the process, then add more as needed.

## Getting Started

Ready to add your first integration?

**Recommended First Integration**:
- **GitHub** (if you code)
- **Slack** (if you collaborate)
- **Google Drive** (if you backup/share)
- **File System** (if you want enhanced local access)

Just say "add integration" and specify which tool!
