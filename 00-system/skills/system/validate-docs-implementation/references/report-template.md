## Implementation Analysis

### What the Code Actually Does

[Summarize implementation truth - what files/folders/behavior the code creates]

**Creates**:
- [List all artifacts with counts]
- Example: 4 directories (01-planning/, 02-resources/, 03-working/, 04-outputs/)
- Example: 3 files in 01-planning/ (overview.md, plan.md, steps.md)

**Does NOT Create** (documented but missing):
- [List things docs mentioned but code doesn't create]
- Example: design.md (old name, removed)
- Example: requirements.md (never existed)

**Key Details**:
- [Important implementation notes]
- [Edge cases or special handling]

```bash
# File name searches
grep -r "design\.md\|tasks\.md\|requirements\.md" 00-system/

# Folder structure searches
grep -r "02-working\|03-outputs" 00-system/

# Verification searches
grep -r "design\.md" 00-system/  # Should return 0
grep -r "tasks\.md" 00-system/   # Should return 0
```

## Usage Notes

### Filling Out the Template

1. **Replace ALL placeholders** in [brackets]
2. **Include specific examples** - don't leave generic text
3. **Be comprehensive** - document every change made
4. **Link to files** - use markdown links so user can click through
5. **Include grep commands** - so validation can be reproduced

### What to Emphasize

**Critical Sections** (must be complete):
- Executive Summary (user reads this first)
- Implementation Analysis (ground truth)
- Fixes Applied (detailed changelog)
- Verification Results (proof it worked)

**Important Sections** (provide context):
- Mismatches Identified (categorization helps future work)
- Statistics (shows scope of validation)
- Recommendations (actionable next steps)

**Optional Sections** (nice to have):
- Appendix (for reproducibility)
- Metadata (for organization)

### Report File Naming

**Format**: `validation-{implementation-name}-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**Examples**:
- `validation-init-project-2025-11-24.md`
- `validation-create-skill-2025-11-24.md`
- `validation-nexus-loader-2025-11-24.md`
- `validation-system-wide-2025-11-24.md`

**Why this format**:
- Searchable by implementation name
- Chronologically sortable
- Clear purpose (validation report)
- No spaces (filesystem friendly)

### Storage Locations

**Option 1: Workspace (Recommended)**
- Location: `04-workspace/validation-reports/`
- Pros: Organized, searchable, part of user's work
- Cons: Not in version control by default

**Option 2: Memory**
- Location: `01-memory/validation-reports/`
- Pros: Persistent, part of system memory
- Cons: Can clutter memory folder

**Option 3: Custom**
- Location: User-specified
- Pros: Maximum flexibility
- Cons: Needs to be tracked separately
