## 🎯 What is Nexus?

**Nexus is a self-guiding work organization system** that runs entirely through conversation with Claude AI. It helps you:

- **Track temporal work** with projects (planning → execution → outputs)
- **Capture reusable workflows** with skills
- **Preserve context** across AI sessions with memory
- **Auto-detect what to load** via YAML-driven metadata
- **Never start from scratch** - the system remembers everything

### Core Philosophy

1. **Instruction-Driven**: Python script analyzes state and returns complete instructions (no AI interpretation)
2. **YAML-Driven**: Everything has metadata that describes when to load it
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Load minimum at start, more context just-in-time
4. **State in Data**: Logic lives in data files, not code
5. **Context Preservation**: All context is saved, nothing is lost between sessions
6. **Self-Documenting**: System generates navigation from file metadata
7. **Skill-First Execution**: Skills have priority over projects in routing

---

## 🗺️ The Three Navigation Maps

Nexus has **3 specialized maps** that guide you through different aspects of the system:

### 1. [System Map](../system-map.md) 📊

**What it covers**: System framework and structure

**Use it for**:
- Understanding the folder structure
- Finding system skills (create-project, create-skill, etc.)
- Learning how the loader and orchestrator work
- Seeing the complete system architecture

**Key sections**:
- System structure diagram
- Core infrastructure (loader, orchestrator)
- System skills reference (24 built-in skills)
- YAML metadata formats
- Startup loading sequence

---

### 2. [Memory Map](../../01-memory/memory-map.md) 🧠

**What it covers**: Context persistence system

**Use it for**:
- Understanding how memory works
- Finding your goals, roadmap, and learnings
- Locating session reports
- Understanding what gets saved automatically

**Key files**:
- `goals.md` - Your objectives and success criteria
- `roadmap.md` - Short/long-term plans
- `core-learnings.md` - Patterns and insights
- `session-reports/` - Historical work summaries

---

### 3. [Workspace Map](../../04-workspace/workspace-map.md) 🗺️

**What it covers**: Your custom folder structure

**Use it for**:
- Navigating your personal workspace
- Understanding your custom folder organization
- Finding client folders, research, templates, etc.

**Created during**: Project 01 (First Project) during onboarding

## 🚀 Instruction-Driven Architecture (Critical)

### The Master Controller Pattern

**Key Principle**: The Python script (`nexus-loader.py`) is the MASTER CONTROLLER. All orchestration logic lives there.

The script doesn't just return file lists - it returns **COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS**:

```json
{
  "system_state": "first_time_with_defaults",
  "memory_content": {
    "system-map.md": "...(embedded content)...",
    "goals.md": "...(embedded content)...",
    "user-config.yaml": "...(embedded content)..."
  },
  "instructions": {
    "action": "display_menu",
    "suggest_onboarding": true,
    "message": "Welcome to Nexus! Quick Start Mode active.",
    "reason": "Smart defaults created - system ready for immediate use"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "projects": [...],
    "skills": [...]
  }
}
```

### Why This Matters

**Traditional Approach** (Error-Prone):
```
AI → Detect state → Guess what to do → Load files → Execute
```

**Nexus Approach** (Bulletproof):
```
Script → Analyze state → Return instructions → AI follows exactly
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Zero interpretation** - AI doesn't guess, just executes
- ✅ **Zero manual state detection** - Script handles all edge cases
- ✅ **Deterministic behavior** - Same state = Same instructions
- ✅ **Easy debugging** - Instructions are explicit and visible
- ✅ **Simple orchestrator.md** - Just "follow the instructions"

---

## 🔄 The Three-Step Startup Pattern

**EVERY session follows this bulletproof pattern:**

### Step 1: Run Startup Script

```bash
python 00-system/core/nexus-loader.py --startup
```

The script analyzes system state and returns:
- `system_state` - Current state (first_time_with_defaults, operational, operational_with_active_projects)
- `memory_content` - Dictionary of file contents (already embedded, keyed by filename)
- `instructions` - Complete instructions for what to do next
- `metadata` - Projects and skills metadata (YAML scan)
- `stats` - System statistics and flags for menu display

---

### Step 2: Use Embedded Content

The `memory_content` dictionary contains file contents already loaded - no separate Read calls needed:

```python
# Content is already embedded in the response
goals_content = startup['memory_content']['goals.md']
config_content = startup['memory_content']['user-config.yaml']
```

**Result**: Zero "file not found" errors (script only lists files that exist)

---

### Step 3: Follow Instructions

Read `instructions.action` and execute exactly as specified:

#### Action: `load_and_execute_project`

```python
project_id = startup['instructions']['project_id']
mode = startup['instructions']['execution_mode']

# Display message
print(startup['instructions']['message'])

# Load project files
python nexus-loader.py --project {project_id}

# Read all planning files in parallel
Read: {project}/01-planning/overview.md
Read: {project}/01-planning/plan.md
Read: {project}/01-planning/steps.md

# Execute based on mode
if mode == 'immediate':
    begin_executing_tasks()
else:
    display_context_and_wait_for_user()
```

#### Action: `display_menu`

```python
display_nexus_banner()
show_goals()
show_projects()
show_skills()
wait_for_user_input()
```

**That's it!** The script tells you exactly what to do. No guessing, no interpretation.

---

## 🎓 The Onboarding System (Optional Skills)

> **Updated 2025-12:** Nexus now uses **optional skill-based onboarding** instead of forced projects. Smart defaults are auto-created on first run, so users can start working immediately.

### Quick Start Mode (New Default)

First-time users get **smart defaults** automatically created:
- `01-memory/goals.md` - Template with placeholder goals
- `01-memory/user-config.yaml` - Default configuration
- `01-memory/core-learnings.md` - Empty learnings file
- `01-memory/memory-map.md` - Memory navigation

**Result**: User sees menu immediately and can start working. No forced onboarding!

### 6 Optional Onboarding Skills

When ready to learn, users can invoke any skill by trigger phrase:

| Skill | Trigger Phrases | Duration |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **setup-goals** | "setup goals", "personalize goals" | 8-10 min |
| **setup-workspace** | "setup workspace", "configure folders" | 5-8 min |
| **learn-integrations** | "learn integrations", "connect tools" | 10-12 min |
| **learn-projects** | "learn projects", "how do projects work" | 8-10 min |
| **learn-skills** | "learn skills", "how do skills work" | 10-12 min |
| **learn-nexus** | "learn nexus", "system mastery" | 15-18 min |

**Total if all completed**: ~55 minutes (but completely optional!)

### Legacy Onboarding (4 Projects)

The original 4-project onboarding still exists for users who prefer structured learning:

### Project 00: Define Goals (8-10 min) - V2.0 Redesign

**Status**: First onboarding project
**Philosophy**: **CONCRETE BEFORE ABSTRACT**

#### V2.0 Improvements

| Metric | V1.0 (Old) | V2.0 (New) | Impact |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Time** | 12-15 min | 8-10 min | 33% faster |
| **Vocabulary** | 15+ terms | 4 terms | 73% reduction |
| **Tasks** | 40 | 16 | 60% fewer |
| **Structure** | Abstract→Concrete | Concrete→Abstract | Grounded learning |
| **Time to value** | 12 min | 5 min | 58% faster |
| **Drop-off risk** | 35-45% | <15% | 70% improvement |

#### The Journey

**Section 0: Welcome + Language (30 seconds)**
- Simple welcome
- Language selection (enforced for ALL subsequent interactions)
- NO system complexity before context exists

**Section 1: Your Goals (5 minutes) - CONCRETE FIRST**
- What do you do? (role + work pattern)
- 3-month goal + AI suggests metrics
- 6-12 month vision + AI suggests milestones
- Confirm understanding
- **AI Suggestion Framework**: Suggest, don't prescribe. Always allow refinement.

**Section 2: Optional Context (15 seconds) - FYI ONLY**
- Brief mention of `00-input/` folder
- NO stopping, NO checking, NO pressure

**Section 3: Create Your Workspace (2 minutes) - ACTION**
- Execute `init-memory.py` with user's actual content
- Show file tree (visual confirmation)
- Brief explanations of each file
- **Experience before explanation**

**Section 4: Understanding Memory (2 minutes) - EXPLANATION**
- Explain what just happened (grounded in experience)
- Show the value (tomorrow's persistence)
- Connect to user's goal
- Introduce 4 terms: Memory, Goals, Sessions, close-session

**Section 5: Close-Session Habit (2 minutes) - CRITICAL**
- Introduce the most important habit
- Explain what close-session does
- Practice it RIGHT NOW (immediate practice)
- Execute and show it working

**Section 6: What's Next (1 minute)**
- Preview the 3 remaining sessions
- Show progress made today
- Clear next step

#### What Gets Created

By the end of Project 00:
- ✅ `01-memory/goals.md` - YOUR role, work pattern, goals
- ✅ `01-memory/roadmap.md` - YOUR milestones, metrics, priorities
- ✅ `01-memory/user-config.yaml` - YOUR language and preferences
- ✅ `01-memory/core-learnings.md` - Insight capture template
- ✅ `01-memory/session-reports/` - Session summary folder

**All files contain YOUR actual content—no placeholders!**

#### Design Principles Applied

**Learning Science**:
- **Bloom's Taxonomy**: Start at "Knowledge" level (your goals), not "Analysis" (system architecture)
- **Constructivist Learning**: Experience before explanation (grounded learning)
- **Problem-Based Learning**: Need (your goals) drives solution discovery
- **Cognitive Load Theory**: 4 terms total respects working memory limits (Miller's Law)
- **Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve**: Experience + immediate practice = 80% retention
- **Peak-End Rule**: Peak = goals captured in 5 min, End = close-session works perfectly

## 🔄 How It All Works Together

### Session Start (Instruction-Driven)

```
1. Run: python nexus-loader.py --startup
   ↓
2. Script analyzes system state:
   - Check if goals.md exists
   - Check if onboarding complete
   - Check for current focus
   - Detect system state
   ↓
3. Script returns instructions:
   {
     "system_state": "operational",
     "memory_content": {
       "system-map.md": "...(embedded)...",
       "goals.md": "...(embedded)...",
       "user-config.yaml": "...(embedded)..."
     },
     "instructions": {
       "action": "display_menu"
     },
     "metadata": {
       "projects": [...],
       "skills": [...]
     }
   }
   ↓
4. AI uses memory_content (already embedded)
   ↓
5. AI follows instructions (display_menu):
   - Show Nexus banner
   - Show your goals
   - Show active projects
   - Show available skills
   - Wait for user input
```

### During Work (Skill-First Execution)

**Priority 1: Check for matching skill** (MOST IMPORTANT)

```
User: "generate status report"
  ↓
AI scans metadata.skills:
  - Match "status report" → weekly-status-report skill
  ↓
Load skill:
  python nexus-loader.py --skill weekly-status-report
  ↓
Read: 03-skills/weekly-status-report/SKILL.md
  ↓
Execute workflow in SKILL.md
```

**Priority 2: Check for project name match**

```
User: "continue working on website"
  ↓
AI scans metadata.projects:
  - Match "website" → 05-website-development
  ↓
Load project:
  python nexus-loader.py --project 05-website-development
  ↓
Read in parallel:
  - 02-projects/05-website-development/01-planning/overview.md
  - 02-projects/05-website-development/01-planning/plan.md
  - 02-projects/05-website-development/01-planning/steps.md
  ↓
Show: Next unchecked task
  ↓
User works on task
  ↓
Context flows to project files
```

**Priority 3: General response** (Fallback - should be RARE)

```
User: "What's the weather like?"
  ↓
No skill match, no project match
  ↓
Respond naturally + suggest creating project/skill if needed
```

**This priority order is THE most important orchestration principle in Nexus.**

### Session End (close-session skill)

```
User: "done for now"
  ↓
AI triggers: close-session skill
  ↓
Skill workflow:
  1. Update task progress:
     - Mark completed tasks with [x]
     - Calculate progress percentage
  ↓
  2. Create session report:
     - 01-memory/session-reports/{date}.md
     - Summary of work done
     - Decisions made
     - Next steps
  ↓
  4. Clean temp files (if any)
  ↓
  5. Confirm: "Session closed. Progress saved!"
  ↓
All context preserved for next session
```

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### 1. Projects (Temporal Work)

**Purpose**: Organize work with a beginning, middle, and end

**Structure**:
- `01-planning/` - Purpose, plan, execution steps (overview.md, plan.md, steps.md)
- `02-resources/` - Reference materials
- `03-working/` - Work-in-progress files
- `04-outputs/` - Final deliverables

**Lifecycle**: PLANNING → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETING → COMPLETE → ARCHIVED

**State Source**: Checkbox list in `steps.md`

**Planning Files**:
- **overview.md**: Purpose, success criteria, context, timeline (YAML frontmatter)
- **plan.md**: Approach, decisions, dependencies, mental models applied
- **steps.md**: Execution checklist broken down into phases

**YAML Metadata** (in overview.md):
```yaml
---
id: 05-website-development
name: Website Development
status: IN_PROGRESS
description: Load when user mentions "website", "web dev", "homepage"
created: 2025-11-01
last_worked: 2025-11-04
tags: [web, design]
---
```

**Note**: `tasks_total`, `tasks_completed`, and `progress` are **calculated automatically** by nexus-loader from steps.md checkboxes. **Do NOT store in YAML**.

---

### 2. Skills (Reusable Workflows)

**Purpose**: Capture repeatable workflows for common tasks

**Structure**:
- `SKILL.md` - Main workflow (<500 lines)
- `references/` - Detailed documentation
- `scripts/` - Automation code
- `assets/` - Files needed by skill

**V2.0 YAML Format** (minimal metadata):
```yaml
---
name: weekly-status-report
description: Load when user says "status report", "weekly update", "progress summary". Generate comprehensive weekly work summary with completed tasks, decisions made, and next steps.
---
```

**Progressive Disclosure**:
1. **Metadata** (always loaded) - name + description (~50 tokens)
2. **SKILL.md** (loaded when triggered) - main workflow
3. **References** (loaded on-demand) - detailed docs

**Priority**: User skills (03-skills/) have priority over system skills (00-system/skills/)

---

### 3. Memory (Context Persistence)

**Purpose**: Never start from scratch - preserve all context

**What gets saved**:
- **Goals**: Your objectives and success criteria
- **Roadmap**: Short/long-term plans
- **Learnings**: Patterns, insights, best practices
- **Session Reports**: Historical work summaries
- **Project State**: What you were working on
- **User Config**: Language and preferences

**Auto-Updated By**: close-session skill at end of each session

**Key Principle**: Context is cumulative - builds over time

---

### 4. Auto-Detection (YAML-Driven)

**How it works**:

1. **Everything has metadata** (YAML frontmatter)
2. **Description field** contains trigger phrases
3. **AI matches** user message against descriptions
4. **Loads context** when match found

**Example**:

```yaml
# In 02-projects/05-website-development/01-planning/overview.md
---
description: Load when user mentions "website", "web dev", "homepage", "site"
---
```

```
User: "let's work on the homepage"
  ↓
AI matches "homepage" → Loads website project
```

---

### 5. Mental Models (Thinking Frameworks)

**Purpose**: Library of 10 battle-tested thinking frameworks that guide structured planning and decision-making.

**Architecture**:
- **Catalog**: `00-system/mental-models/mental-models.md` - Framework overview
- **References**: `00-system/mental-models/references/mental-models/` - Individual model files
- **Selection Script**: `00-system/mental-models/scripts/select_mental_models.py`

**Two-Tier System**:
- **Tier 1 (Foundational)**: First Principles, Socratic Questioning, Devil's Advocate - core thinking tools for all projects
- **Tier 2 (Situational)**: Systems Thinking, Pre-Mortem, Stakeholder Mapping, SWOT, Pareto, Design Thinking, MVP Thinking

**YAML Frontmatter Format** (in mental model files):
```yaml
---
name: First Principles
category: cognitive
tier: 1
best_for: Novel projects, challenging assumptions
questions:
  - What are we assuming here?
  - What would we do if starting from scratch?
  - What's the fundamental truth we can build on?
---
```

**Offering Pattern** (used in create-project, execute-project):
```markdown
AI runs: python 00-system/mental-models/scripts/select_mental_models.py
  ↓
AI reviews JSON output with all available models
  ↓
AI offers 2-3 relevant models to user:

"For your Build/Create project, I recommend:

1. **First Principles** – Strip assumptions, find fundamental truths
   Best for: Novel projects, challenging assumptions

2. **Pre-Mortem** – Imagine failure modes before implementation
   Best for: High-stakes projects, risk mitigation

Which approach(es) sound most useful? Or we can combine them!"
  ↓
User picks: "First Principles + Pre-Mortem"
  ↓
AI loads: mental-models/references/cognitive-models.md (First Principles section)
AI loads: mental-models/references/diagnostic-models.md (Pre-Mortem section)
  ↓
AI applies questions from selected models to fill plan.md
```

**Integration Points**:
- **create-project**: MANDATORY mental model selection during plan.md phase
- **execute-project**: Offered at key decision points (section completion, risk assessment)
- **create-skill**: Offered for workflow design decisions

**Token Efficiency**:
- Metadata only: ~50 tokens (always available)
- Selected models: ~2K tokens (loaded on-demand)
- Full catalog: ~15K tokens (never loaded entirely)

**See**: [`mental-models framework`](../mental-models/mental-models.md) for full catalog

---

### 6. Bulk-Complete Automation (Task Tracking)

**Purpose**: Automatic task completion when work is done, eliminating manual checkbox tedium.

**How It Works**:
```
Project work completed this session
  ↓
close-session skill detects completion signals:
  - "done", "finished", "complete"
  - All tasks in section executed
  - User confirms work is done
  ↓
Auto-runs bulk-complete script:
  python 00-system/skills/bulk-complete/scripts/bulk-complete.py \
    --project [ID] --all --no-confirm
  ↓
Validates: Re-reads file to confirm completion
  ↓
Reports: "✅ VALIDATED: 40/40 tasks now complete (100%)"
```

**Script Options**:
```bash
# Complete all tasks (project finished)
python scripts/bulk-complete.py --project 01 --all --no-confirm

# Complete specific phase (phase done)
python scripts/bulk-complete.py --project 01 --section "Phase 2"

# Complete task range (selective)
python scripts/bulk-complete.py --project 01 --tasks 1-5,7,10-15

# Interactive mode (pick tasks)
python scripts/bulk-complete.py --project 01
```

**Safety Features**:
- **Threshold**: Requires context signal (completion detected, not random)
- **Validation**: Re-reads file after completion to confirm
- **Fallback**: Manual Edit tool if script fails
- **Confirmation**: Optional `--no-confirm` flag (safe for auto-triggers)

**Time Savings**: 5-10 minutes per project (eliminates manual checkbox marking)

**Integration Points**:
- **close-session**: Auto-runs bulk-complete when project complete (Step 2)
- **execute-project**: Offers bulk-complete after each section
- **Manual trigger**: "bulk complete [project]" or "mark all tasks done"

**See**: [`bulk-complete skill`](../skills/bulk-complete/SKILL.md) for complete usage

### 7. Dynamic Template System (Project Types)

**Purpose**: Type-specific plan.md templates that eliminate the blank page problem with domain-specific structure.

**6 Project Types**:
| Type | Best For | Template Sections |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Build/Create** | Software, features, products | Technical Architecture, Implementation Strategy, Integration Points |
| **Research/Analysis** | Investigations, studies | Research Questions, Data Sources, Analysis Framework |
| **Strategy/Planning** | Roadmaps, decisions | Stakeholder Analysis, Options Evaluation, Decision Framework |
| **Content/Creative** | Writing, design, media | Audience, Format, Distribution Channels |
| **Process/Workflow** | Automation, optimization | Current State, Bottlenecks, Improvement Plan |
| **Generic** | Anything else | Flexible structure |

**Type Selection Workflow** (in create-project):
```
AI: "What type of project is this?"
  ↓
Offer 6 types with brief descriptions
  ↓
User selects: "Build/Create"
  ↓
init_project.py generates plan.md with Build-specific sections:
  ## Technical Architecture
  ## Implementation Strategy
  ## Integration Points
  ## Testing Approach
  ## Deployment Plan
```

**Template Injection** (init_project.py):
```python
def create_plan_template(project_type):
    templates = {
        'build': BUILD_TEMPLATE,      # Technical sections
        'research': RESEARCH_TEMPLATE, # Analysis sections
        'strategy': STRATEGY_TEMPLATE, # Decision sections
        'content': CONTENT_TEMPLATE,   # Creative sections
        'process': PROCESS_TEMPLATE,   # Workflow sections
        'generic': GENERIC_TEMPLATE    # Flexible sections
    }
    return templates.get(project_type, GENERIC_TEMPLATE)
```

**Benefits**:
- **Better planning quality**: Domain-specific prompts guide thinking
- **Faster planning**: Pre-filled sections reduce blank page paralysis
- **Encoded expertise**: Templates capture best practices for each type
- **Consistency**: All Build projects have same structure

**Template Files Location**:
```
00-system/skills/create-project/scripts/templates/
├── template-build.md
├── template-research.md
├── template-strategy.md
├── template-content.md
├── template-process.md
└── template-generic.md
```

**When to Use Each Type**:
- **Build**: New feature, software project, product development
- **Research**: Market research, technical investigation, user study
- **Strategy**: Quarterly planning, organizational decision, roadmap
- **Content**: Blog post, documentation, video script
- **Process**: Workflow automation, process optimization, efficiency
- **Generic**: Unclear scope, mixed types, or unusual projects

**See**: [`create-project skill`](../skills/create-project/SKILL.md) for complete workflow

## 💡 Design Principles

### 1. Instruction-Driven Architecture

**Principle**: Python script analyzes state and returns complete instructions. AI follows exactly.

**Why**: Zero interpretation, zero ambiguity, deterministic behavior, easy debugging.

**Example**: Script returns `"action": "load_and_execute_project"` with complete workflow steps.

---

### 2. YAML-Driven Auto-Detection

**Principle**: Everything has metadata describing when to load it. AI matches user messages against descriptions.

**Why**: Context loads automatically. No manual routing. Self-documenting.

**Example**: Project description "Load when user mentions 'website'" → User says "website" → Project loads.

---

### 3. Skill-First Execution

**Principle**: Skills have priority over projects in routing. User skills have priority over system skills.

**Why**: Reusable workflows are more valuable than one-off project work. Encourages workflow capture.

**Example**: "status report" matches skill → Executes skill (doesn't search projects first).

---

### 4. Progressive Disclosure

**Principle**: Load minimum at start (just metadata), more context just-in-time (when needed).

**Why**: Efficient token usage. Fast startup. Context loads when relevant.

**Example**: Metadata (~50 tokens) always loaded. SKILL.md (~2000 tokens) loaded when triggered.

---

### 5. State in Data Files

**Principle**: System state tracked in YAML metadata. Task progress tracked in steps.md checkboxes. No logic in code.

**Why**: Transparent. Inspectable. Debuggable. AI can read state directly.

**Example**: System state tracked in user-config.yaml and project metadata, not in Python variables.

---

### 6. Context Preservation

**Principle**: Nothing is lost between sessions. All work saved automatically. Session reports build historical record.

**Why**: Never start from scratch. Cumulative learning. Historical awareness.

**Example**: close-session updates memory, saves progress, creates session report.

---

### 7. Concrete Before Abstract (Onboarding)

**Principle**: Experience first, explanation after. Value delivery before feature teaching.

**Why**: Grounded learning. Higher retention. Lower cognitive load. Better engagement.

**Example**: Project 00 captures goals (5 min) BEFORE explaining system architecture.

---

## 🎓 Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Project** | Temporal work with beginning, middle, end (e.g., client website) |
| **Skill** | Reusable workflow for repetitive tasks (e.g., weekly report) |
| **Memory** | Context persistence system (goals, learnings, session reports) |
| **YAML Frontmatter** | Metadata at top of files (between `---` markers) |
| **Auto-Detection** | System automatically loads context based on YAML descriptions |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | Load minimum first, more context on-demand |
| **Session** | Single conversation with AI (start → work → close) |
| **Context** | All information relevant to current work |
| **Instruction-Driven** | Script returns complete instructions, AI follows exactly |
| **Skill-First** | Skills have priority over projects in routing |
| **Onboarding** | 4-project journey (00-03) to learn system (35-40 min) |

## 🔮 Advanced Topics

### Language-First Architecture

Language selection happens in first 30 seconds of Project 00 and is enforced for ALL subsequent interactions. Stored in `01-memory/user-config.yaml`.

Supported: English, Deutsch, Español, Français, 中文, 日本語, Português, Italiano, and more.

### AI Suggestion Framework

5-step collaborative pattern used in onboarding:
1. User provides context
2. AI synthesizes and suggests 2-3 options
3. Ask for resonance ("What resonates with you?")
4. User refines
5. Capture refined version (NOT AI's suggestion)

**Philosophy**: Invitation, not instruction. Collaborative, not prescriptive.

### Token Budget Management

nexus-loader.py monitors total metadata tokens and warns if >7,000 (3.5% of context window).

Progressive disclosure keeps startup lean:
- Metadata: ~50 tokens per skill/project
- SKILL.md: ~2000 tokens (loaded when triggered)
- References: Variable (loaded on-demand)

### Archiving Completed Projects

Use `archive-project` skill to move completed projects to `02-projects/05-archived/`.

Benefits:
- Cleaner project list
- Historical record preserved
- Can unarchive if needed
