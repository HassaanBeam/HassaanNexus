### 00-system/core/

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure components that run the system

#### orchestrator.md

**Purpose**: AI decision logic and routing - defines how Claude processes user requests

**Contents**:
- **Design Principle**: Ultra-simple, no complex state detection, state logic in data files
- **Initialization Sequence**:
  - Step 1: Run startup script (loads 5 core files + generates metadata)
  - Step 2: Display dynamic menu (based on loaded content)
  - Step 3: Smart routing (skills → projects → state checks → session end → general work)
  - Step 4: Context loading rules
- **3-State Model**:
  - Goals empty → Run 00-define-goals project
  - Goals set + no workspace → Create workspace structure
  - Both exist → System operational
- **Smart Routing Logic**:
  1. Match against skill triggers (from system-map.md)
  2. Match against project names (from project-map.md)
  3. Check initialization state (simple 3-state)
  4. Check session end signals (done, finish, close)
  5. Handle general work requests
- **Special Handling**: create-project skill warning system (enforce collaborative design)
- **Context Loading Rules**: What to load always, what to load on-demand, what never to load
- **Error Handling**: Missing files, user confusion, system issues
- **Using nexus-loader.py**: All available commands and why to use the script
- **Critical Principles**:
  - NO complex conditional logic in orchestrator
  - State in data files (project-map.md), not code
  - Dynamic menu based on file content
  - Always load same files at initialization
- **Example Session Flows**: First time user, workspace setup, operational state

**Key Philosophy**:
- Orchestrator is ultra-minimal - it loads data and routes commands
- Actual guidance/logic lives in project files themselves
- State detection from data files, not hard-coded logic

**Location Note**: Lives in `core/` because it's fundamental infrastructure, loaded every session

---

#### nexus-loader.py

**Purpose**: Python script for loading context and generating metadata

**What It Does**:
- Loads core files at session start (5 files)
- Scans all projects in `02-projects/` for YAML metadata
- Scans all skills in `00-system/skills/` and `03-skills/` for YAML metadata
- Generates current timestamp
- Returns structured JSON output
- Monitors token budget (warns if >7,000 tokens)
- Provides on-demand loading for specific projects/skills
- Auto-loads skill resources (references, scripts, assets)

**Commands**:
```bash
# Session startup (5 files + metadata generation)
python 00-system/core/nexus-loader.py --startup

# Load specific project (all planning files + metadata)
python nexus-loader.py --project {project-id}

# Load specific skill (SKILL.md + auto-load declared resources)
python nexus-loader.py --skill {skill-name}

# List all projects (YAML metadata only, no file contents)
python nexus-loader.py --list-projects

# List all skills (YAML metadata only, no file contents)
python nexus-loader.py --list-skills

# Show token usage breakdown
python nexus-loader.py --show-tokens
```

**Output Format**:
```json
{
  "loaded_at": "2025-11-03T12:22:48",
  "bundle": "startup",
  "files": { /* file contents */ },
  "metadata": {
    "projects": [ /* project YAML data */ ],
    "skills": [ /* skill YAML data */ ]
  },
  "stats": { /* counts and totals */ }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Structured JSON output (consistent format)
- ✅ Automatic YAML parsing (no manual frontmatter extraction)
- ✅ Auto-detection triggers extracted from descriptions
- ✅ Task counting and progress calculation
- ✅ Auto-loading of skill resources
- ✅ Token budget monitoring
- ✅ Timestamp generation
- ✅ Stats aggregation

---

### User Skill Structure: {skill-name}/

**Naming Convention**: `{skill-name}`
- Format: lowercase-with-hyphens
- Prefer verb-based names: `generate-report`, `analyze-data`, `create-proposal`

---

#### SKILL.md

## 04-workspace/ - User Content

### Purpose
User-defined custom folder structure for organizing their work

### Structure
```
04-workspace/
├── workspace-map.md        # User's custom folder guide
└── [User's folders]/       # Custom organization (clients, research, templates, etc.)
```

---

### workspace-map.md

**Purpose**: Document user's custom folder structure

**Initial State**: Template with example structure

**Contents After Setup**:
- User's folder structure diagram
- Folder descriptions (purpose of each folder)
- Organizational philosophy
- Tips for maintenance

**Example Structure**:
```
04-workspace/
├── Clients/              # Client projects and deliverables
│   ├── acme-corp/        # Acme Corporation (2024-2025)
│   └── beta-inc/         # Beta Inc partnership
├── Research/             # Industry research and competitive analysis
└── Templates/            # Reusable templates and resources
```

**Created By**: create-project skill during workspace setup (Session 2)

**Updated**: Manually by user when reorganizing workspace

**Loaded**: Every session via `--startup` command

**Key Principle**: Workspace is YOURS - organize however makes sense for your work

---

### User Folders

**Created By**: User via create-project skill or manually

**Contents**: Whatever the user needs

**Common Patterns**:
- Clients/ - Client work organization
- Projects/ - Real-world projects (not Nexus projects)
- Research/ - Reference materials
- Templates/ - Reusable templates
- Archive/ - Historical files

**Note**: This is the user's content area - completely flexible

---

## Design Patterns and Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure

**Philosophy**: Load minimum at start, more context just-in-time

**Implementation**:
- **Session Start**: Only 5 files + metadata (~7,000 tokens)
- **Skill Trigger**: SKILL.md loaded + auto-load resources
- **Project Work**: Full planning files loaded on-demand
- **Strategic Discussion**: Roadmap/learnings loaded when needed

**Benefit**: Efficient token usage, faster initialization

---

### 2. YAML-Driven Auto-Detection

**Philosophy**: Everything has metadata describing when to load it

**Implementation**:
- `description` field contains trigger phrases
- AI matches user messages against descriptions
- Context loads automatically when match found

**Example**:
```yaml
description: Load when user mentions "website", "web dev", "homepage"
```
User says: "let's work on the homepage"
→ AI loads website project automatically

---

### 3. State in Data Files

**Philosophy**: Logic lives in data files, not code

**Implementation**:
- project-map.md contains state detection logic
- tasks.md checkboxes are source of truth for progress
- Orchestrator reads data and follows instructions

**Benefit**: System behavior is transparent and editable

---

### 4. Context Preservation

**Philosophy**: Never start from scratch - preserve all context

**Implementation**:
- close-session skill updates memory after every session
- Session reports build historical archive
- Project files preserve all decisions
- core-learnings accumulates patterns over time

**Benefit**: Each session builds on previous work

---

### 5. Self-Documenting

**Philosophy**: System generates navigation from metadata

**Implementation**:
- nexus-loader.py scans YAML metadata at runtime
- Maps generated from file structure
- Always shows current state (no stale maps)

**Benefit**: Documentation is always accurate

---

## Token Budget Management

### Session Startup

**Loaded Files** (~7,000 tokens):
- system-map.md (~12,500 chars)
- memory-map.md (~2,000 chars)
- project-map.md (~2,800 chars)
- goals.md (~300 chars initially)
- workspace-map.md (~2,000 chars)

**Metadata** (variable):
- Projects: ~200 tokens per project YAML
- Skills: ~100 tokens per skill YAML

**Warning Threshold**: >7,000 tokens from metadata (3.5% of 200K context)

---

### On-Demand Loading

**Project Load** (~5,000-10,000 tokens):
- overview.md (~500-1,000 tokens)
- requirements.md (~1,000-3,000 tokens)
- design.md (~1,000-3,000 tokens)
- tasks.md (~500-2,000 tokens)

**Skill Load** (~2,000-5,000 tokens):
- SKILL.md (~2,000-5,000 tokens)
- References (if requested): Variable
- Scripts (if requested): Variable

---

### Best Practices

1. **Keep Skills Under 500 Lines**: Use references/ for detailed docs
2. **Break Large Projects into Phases**: Reduce task list size
3. **Archive Completed Projects**: Keep active list small
4. **Use Progressive Disclosure**: Don't load everything upfront
5. **Monitor Token Usage**: Use `--show-tokens` to check

---

## File Naming Conventions

### Projects
- Format: `{ID}-{name}`
- ID: Zero-padded (00, 01, ..., 10, 11)
- Name: lowercase-with-hyphens
- Examples: `05-website-development`, `10-client-onboarding`

### Skills
- Format: `{skill-name}`
- Name: lowercase-with-hyphens
- Prefer verb-based: `generate-report`, `analyze-data`, `create-proposal`
- Examples: `weekly-status-report`, `client-proposal-generator`

### User Folders
- Recommendation: lowercase-with-hyphens (consistency)
- Flexible: User chooses their convention

### Memory Files
- Fixed names: `goals.md`, `roadmap.md`, `core-learnings.md`
- Session reports: `YYYY-MM-DD-{description}.md`

---
