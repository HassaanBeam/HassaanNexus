## How This Works

**User organizes `04-workspace/` however they want** (clients, departments, topics, etc.)
- Create folders that match their work
- No predefined structure - organize naturally

**This file helps AI understand the structure:**
- AI reads this file every session
- Brief descriptions help AI route to right folders
- AI updates this when workspace changes
