# Setup Notion Customer Onboarding

Automate filling and updating Notion customer onboarding template pages with project content.

## Purpose

This skill helps you populate Notion customer onboarding templates by:
- Filling Overview section (Project Summary, Documentation, Flow) from project files
- Updating Quick Links with customer-specific URLs
- Updating 18 onboarding tasks one-by-one with content from your project folder

Uses **Notion MCP** for all content operations.

**Key Features**:
- Direct Notion MCP integration
- Interactive task-by-task updates with user
- Reads project folder structure automatically
- Handles markdown content via MCP

**Time Estimate**: 30-60 minutes (depending on content availability)

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Initialize TodoList

Create TodoWrite with all workflow steps:
```
- [ ] Check/Setup Notion MCP access
- [ ] Get project folder location from user
- [ ] Update Overview section (Project Summary, Documentation, Flow)
- [ ] Update Quick Links section (4 links)
- [ ] Update database tasks one-by-one (18 tasks)
- [ ] Verify all updates completed
- [ ] Close session to save progress
```

This creates transparency and allows progress tracking.

**Mark tasks complete as you finish each step.**

---

### Step 2: Check/Setup Notion MCP Access

**First, check if Notion MCP is available:**

Test: `mcp__notion__notion-search` with a simple query.

**If MCP is NOT available:**
1. Load [references/notion-mcp-setup.md](references/notion-mcp-setup.md)
2. Guide user through MCP installation:
   - Create Notion integration
   - Configure Claude Code config
   - Grant integration access to template page
   - Restart Claude Code
3. Verify setup works

**Get Project Page URL (CRITICAL):**
Ask user: "Please provide the URL of your Notion customer onboarding PROJECT page."
- ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This should be the ACTUAL project page (e.g., "Favorite Staffing - Onboarding"), NOT the template page
- Example: `https://www.notion.so/joinbeam/Customer-Name-Onboarding-...`
- **Store this URL** - all updates will be made to THIS page and its database

**Verify correct page and get database collection URL:**
1. **Fetch the project page**: `mcp__notion__notion-fetch` with user-provided URL
2. **Verify title**: Check the title matches the customer name (not "Customer Onboarding Template")
3. **Get database URL**: Look for `<database url="...">` in the page content
4. **Fetch the database**: `mcp__notion__notion-fetch` with the database URL
5. **Extract collection URL**: From database response, find `<data-source url="collection://...">`
6. **Store both URLs**:
   - Project page URL: `https://www.notion.so/...`
   - Database collection URL: `collection://...`

**Example verification:**
```
✅ Page title: "Favorite Staffing - Onboarding..."
✅ Database URL: https://www.notion.so/2a72cadf...
✅ Collection URL: collection://2a72cadf-bbbc-815c-aae0-000b4ba10232
```

**⚠️ COMMON MISTAKE TO AVOID:**
- Do NOT use template URLs (these have different IDs)
- Template page: `2a92cadf...` ❌
- Project page: `2a72cadf...` ✅
- Each customer project has unique page and database IDs

**Mark this todo complete before proceeding.**

---

### Step 3: Get Project Folder Location

Ask user: "Where is your project folder with content for this onboarding?"

Example response: `04-workspace/Workflow/customer-x-project/`

**Store this path** - it will be used for all content lookups in subsequent steps.

**Optional**: Ask user if they have specific files for certain sections:
- "Do you have a project summary document?"
- "Where are the documentation files?"
- "Where is the agent flow diagram?"

**Mark this todo complete before proceeding.**

---

### Step 4: Update Overview Section

Load [references/template-structure.md](references/template-structure.md) to see structure.

Fetch the main template page using `mcp__notion__notion-fetch` to see current content.

**IMPORTANT: Keep Overview section HIGH-LEVEL and CONCISE**
- This section is rarely updated after initial setup
- Focus on: scope, project description, problem statement, and goals
- Avoid detailed content - save that for the database tasks
- Maximum 3-5 bullet points per subsection

**CRITICAL: This page is CLIENT-FACING**
- DO NOT reference local file paths (e.g., `04-workspace/doc/file.md`)
- DO NOT expose internal file names or folder structures
- If content needs to be shared: Create Notion sub-pages and copy client-appropriate content
- Remove any internal notes, credentials, or sensitive information
- Only include client-relevant information

**For each subsection:**

#### 4.1: Project Summary
1. Look in project folder for: `*summary*`, `*overview*`, `*objectives*`, `README.md`
2. Extract only: scope, problem statement, main goal, success criteria (1-2 sentences each)
3. Ask user: "Use this concise summary for Project Summary?"
4. **Update via MCP:**
   - Use `mcp__notion__notion-update-page` to update content
   - Update the placeholder `[Enter Project Summary here along with Objectives/ Success Criteria]`
   - Keep it to 3-5 bullet points maximum

#### 4.2: Documentation
1. Look in project folder for: `*doc*`, `*spec*`, `*requirements*`
2. Ask user: "Which documents should be shared with client? Should I create Notion sub-pages for them?"
3. **Options:**
   - Create Notion sub-pages and copy client-appropriate content
   - Link to external documents (Google Docs, shared PDFs)
   - Provide high-level description without file references
4. **NEVER** include local file paths or internal file names
5. List 3-5 most important documents maximum

#### 4.3: Flow
1. Look in project folder for: `*flow*`, `*diagram*`, `*architecture*`, `*.png`, `*.jpg`
2. Ask user: "Which file/image is the agent flow?"
3. For text descriptions: Keep to 3-5 high-level steps only
4. For images: Link or embed the diagram directly

**Mark this todo complete before proceeding.**

---

### Step 5: Update Quick Links Section

Fetch the current Quick Links from the template page.

Ask user for each link (skip Beam Academy - line 39 in template structure says "no need to update"):

1. **Beam Platform Login**: "What's the customer's Beam platform workspace URL?"
2. **Template Agent Workshop** (Miro): "What's the Miro board URL for this customer?"
3. **Test Case Database** (Airtable): "What's the Airtable URL for test cases?"
4. **Integration Input** (Google Sheets): "What's the Google Sheets URL for integrations?"

**Update callouts** using `mcp__notion__notion-update-page` to replace the generic template URLs.

**Mark this todo complete before proceeding.**

---

### Step 6: Update Database Tasks One-by-One

Load [references/template-structure.md](references/template-structure.md) for complete task list.

**Get all tasks from database:**
1. **Use the collection URL from Step 2** (stored earlier when you verified the project page)
2. Use `mcp__notion__notion-search` with `data_source_url: <collection URL>`
3. ⚠️ **DO NOT use hardcoded collection URL** - each project has its own database

**Example search:**
```
mcp__notion__notion-search
query: "onboarding task"
data_source_url: "collection://2a72cadf-bbbc-815c-aae0-000b4ba10232"
```

**Task count may vary:** Most projects have ~18 tasks, but actual count depends on the specific onboarding plan.

**For EACH task:**

**Step 1: Fetch & Analyze**
1. **Fetch task page**: `mcp__notion__notion-fetch` with task URL
2. **Check Status from properties**: Look at the `Status` field in the fetched page properties
   - If Status = "Done" OR "Complete" → **SKIP automatically** (task already complete)
   - Only proceed if Status = "To-Do" OR "In progress" OR similar incomplete status
3. **Analyze current content**: What's already in the task? Is it template content or real content?

**Step 2: Check Folders**
4. **Search project folders** for relevant content:
   - 04-workspace/meeting/ - meeting notes, kick-off materials
   - 04-workspace/doc/ - documentation, specifications, proposals
   - 04-workspace/Workflow/ - workflow diagrams, agent designs, critical questions
5. **Match task name with folder content**: Look for keywords, related topics

**Step 3: Make Recommendation**
6. **Determine if update needed**:
   - Current content is template → Found relevant files → **RECOMMEND UPDATE**
   - Current content is template → No relevant files → **RECOMMEND SKIP** (leave as template)
   - Current content has real data → Found different files → **RECOMMEND UPDATE** (ask first!)
   - Current content has real data → No new files → **RECOMMEND SKIP** (already complete)
7. **Show suggestion**:
   - "Task X: [Current content summary]"
   - "Found: [files or 'nothing']"
   - "Recommendation: [Update/Skip] because [reason]"
8. **Ask confirmation**: "Proceed with [recommendation]?"

**Step 4: Execute (only if approved)**
9. **WAIT FOR USER CONFIRMATION** before any update
10. **If approved**: Update via `mcp__notion__notion-update-page`
11. **Show progress**: "Task X/18 complete"
7. **If approved**:
   - Use `mcp__notion__notion-update-page` to update task page content
8. **If content NOT found**:
   - Ask: "Where can I find content for this task, or should we skip it?"
9. **Update task status** if needed (with user confirmation)
10. **Show progress**: "Task X/18 complete"

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULES:**
- ⚠️ NEVER overwrite existing content without explicit user confirmation
- ⚠️ ALWAYS fetch and show current content first
- ⚠️ Tasks may have been manually updated - respect existing work
- ⚠️ SKIP tasks with Status = "Done" automatically
- ⚠️ When in doubt, ask before updating

**Process by stage** (helps user follow along):
- Discovery Stage: ~9 tasks
- Build Stage: ~5 tasks
- Optimize Stage: ~3 tasks
- Go-Live Testing Stage: ~1 task

**Common task patterns across projects:**
- **Meeting tasks**: Usually have booking templates ready - recommend skip unless custom content needed
- **Already completed tasks** (Status = "Done"): Auto-skip per safety rules
- **In progress tasks**: Check if they already have real content before updating
- **Blank pages**: Good candidates for updates if relevant content exists

**Efficiency tips:**
- Many tasks will be skipped (meetings, already done, already have content)
- Focus updates on tasks that need project-specific content
- Typical projects: Update 3-5 tasks, skip 13-15 tasks

**Mark this todo complete when all tasks processed.**

### Step 7: Verify All Updates Completed

Summarize what was updated:
```
✅ Overview Section:
   - Project Summary: Updated
   - Documentation: Updated
   - Flow: Updated

✅ Quick Links:
   - Beam Platform: Updated
   - Miro Workshop: Updated
   - Airtable Database: Updated
   - Google Sheets: Updated

✅ Database Tasks: 18/18 updated
   - Discovery: 9 tasks
   - Build: 5 tasks
   - Optimize: 3 tasks
   - Go-Live Testing: 1 task
```

Ask user: "Would you like to review any specific section before we close?"

**Mark this todo complete before proceeding.**

---

### Step 8: Close Session

Once the workflow is complete, **automatically trigger the close-session skill**:

```
Auto-triggering close-session to save progress...
```

The close-session skill will:
- Update system memory with this session's work
- Save context for next session
- Create session report
- Clean up temporary files

**This is the final mandatory step.** Do not skip - it ensures all progress is preserved.

## Notes

**About MCP Updates**:
- All content updates use Notion MCP directly
- MCP handles markdown content automatically
- Works with content of any length

**About Task Updates**:
- Tasks are processed one-by-one interactively with user
- This ensures quality and gives user control over content
- User can skip tasks if content isn't ready

**Common Pitfalls & Solutions**:
1. **Wrong database**: Always verify you're using the PROJECT page URL, not template
   - Symptom: Updates don't appear in user's page
   - Fix: Fetch project page → Get database URL → Get collection URL

2. **Hardcoded URLs**: Never hardcode page/database/collection URLs
   - Each project has unique IDs
   - Always fetch and extract URLs dynamically

3. **Over-updating**: Many tasks are already complete or are meeting templates
   - Most projects: 3-5 tasks need updates, 13-15 can be skipped
   - Check Status field and existing content first

**Troubleshooting**:
- If MCP fails: Check references/notion-mcp-setup.md
- Verify integration has access to all pages you want to update
- Restart Claude Code if MCP connection issues occur
- If updates don't appear: Verify you're using correct project page URL (not template)
