# Beam AI Solutions Engineer - Case Study Requirements

**Source**: Solutions - Case Study _ Gamma.pdf
**Expected Time**: 3-4 hours

---

## Overview

Candidates must win a fictional project with **EcomCorp** - a global e-commerce organization automating their order processing system.

- EcomCorp receives thousands of orders daily from various regions
- Different formats, structures, and details
- Current manual data extraction is inefficient
- Candidates get a test dataset to validate their approach

## Task 1: AI Prompt Engineering (Core Technical Test)

### Requirements
- Submit a single, well-crafted extraction prompt
- Prompt must extract ALL required variables from the dataset
- Use golden dataset to showcase accuracy (AI Output = Expected Output)

### Variables to Extract
From order confirmation PDFs/documents:
- `buyer_company_name`
- `buyer_person_name`
- `buyer_email_address`
- `order_number`
- `order_date`
- `delivery_address_street`
- `delivery_address_postal_code`
- `delivery_address_city`
- `product_position`
- `product_article_code`
- `product_quantity`

### Evaluation Criteria
- Variable-level accuracy
- Standardized, uniform output format
- Adaptability across different document formats
- Robustness of prompt design

### Dataset
- Location: Available in Notion
- Contains: Input Document Files (PDFs), Input Emails, Expected Output

## Task 2: Project Plan

### Requirements
Create a comprehensive project plan for implementing automated order processing.

### Key Elements
1. **Objectives & KPIs** - Clear, measurable goals
2. **Timeline & Resources** - Realistic timeline, necessary resources
3. **Phased Plan & Milestones** - Project phases, key milestones, acceptance criteria

### Expectations

## Task 3: Presentation (5-10 slides)

### Purpose
Create presentation as if selling to EcomCorp

### Content Requirements
**For Task 1:**
- Why you designed your prompt the way you did
- What obstacles you encountered and how you solved them
- How you used AI to complete the task

**For Task 2:**
- Showcase your project plan
