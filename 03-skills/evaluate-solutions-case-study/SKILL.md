# Evaluate Solutions Case Study

Systematically identify strengths and weaknesses in Solutions AI Engineer candidate case study submissions.

## Purpose

Evaluate candidate submissions for the Solutions AI Engineer role by analyzing three key components: extraction prompt quality, project plan depth, and presentation effectiveness. Produces a structured strengths/weaknesses analysis to support consistent hiring decisions.

**Time Estimate**: 15-25 minutes per candidate

---

## Required Context (Load Before Evaluating)

Before evaluating any candidate submission, load these reference materials to understand what the candidate was asked to do:

1. **Case Study Requirements**: `case-study-materials/case-study-requirements.md`
   - Full task instructions given to candidates
   - Expected deliverables for each task

2. **Test Dataset**: `case-study-materials/case-study-dataset/Mid Level AI Solution Engineer Case Study/`
   - **Expected outputs**: `Test Dataset...csv` - Contains emails and expected extraction results
   - **Source PDFs** (10 order documents candidates must extract from):
     - `BauerTech-GmbH.pdf`
     - `Hofbauer-Eng-GmBH.pdf`
     - `Mller-Industrial-GmBH.pdf`
     - `NORSE-tech-GmBH.PDF`
     - `NT-Precision-GmBH.pdf`
     - `Schneider-Metallbau-GmbH.pdf`
     - `Steinbach-GmBH.pdf`
     - `Technovac-GmBH.pdf`
     - `Weber-Tools-GmbH.pdf`
     - `ZMT-Precision-GmBH.pdf`
   - Varying complexity (1-10 products per order)

3. **Full Brief (optional)**: `case-study-materials/Solutions-Case-Study.pdf`
   - Complete PDF sent to candidates

### Required Extraction Fields (11 total)

The candidate's prompt must extract these fields from German B2B order documents:

**Buyer (3 fields):**
- `buyer_company_name`
- `buyer_person_name`
- `buyer_email_address`

**Order (5 fields):**
- `order_number`
- `order_date` (German format: DD.MM.YYYY)
- `delivery_address_street`
- `delivery_address_postal_code`
- `delivery_address_city`

**Product (3 fields, repeated per line item):**
- `product_position`
- `product_article_code`
- `product_quantity`

**Note**: Orders contain 1-10 products each. A complete prompt must handle multiple products per order.

## Scoring Rubric

### Score Scale (1-5)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **5** | Exceptional - Exceeds expectations, demonstrates mastery |
| **4** | Strong - Fully meets expectations, minor improvements possible |
| **3** | Acceptable - Meets basic expectations, some gaps |
| **2** | Weak - Below expectations, significant gaps |
| **1** | Poor - Does not meet expectations, major issues |

### Categories (4 total, 25 points each)

**1. Prompt Engineering** (from Task 1)
| Criterion | What to Score |
|-----------|---------------|

| Stakeholder Touchpoints | Built-in client communication, approval gates, expectation management |
| Resource & Scope Clarity | Clear on what's needed, explicit assumptions and trade-offs |

**4. Communication & Sales** (from Task 3)
| Criterion | What to Score |
|-----------|---------------|
| Narrative Flow | Problem → Solution → Value story, logical progression |
| Technical Translation | Explains complex concepts in client-friendly language |
| Value Proposition | Clear ROI, business benefits articulated, not just features |
| Visual Clarity | Clean slides, appropriate use of diagrams/graphics, not cluttered |
| Call to Action | Clear next steps, creates urgency or engagement path |
