## Workflow

### Step 1: Select HubSpot List

**Find available lists:**
```bash
python3 00-system/skills/hubspot/hubspot-master/scripts/query_list.py --show-lists
```

**For DYNAMIC lists (not shown by default):**
```python
# Search all list types including DYNAMIC
POST https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/lists/search
{
    "listIds": [],
    "offset": 0,
    "query": "",
    "count": 500,
    "additionalProperties": ["hs_list_size"]
}
```

---

### Step 2: Extract Companies from HubSpot

```python
# Get list members
GET /crm/v3/lists/{list_id}/memberships?limit=120

# Get company details (batch)
POST /crm/v3/objects/companies/batch/read
{
    "inputs": [{"id": "company_id_1"}, {"id": "company_id_2"}],
    "properties": ["name", "domain", "industry", "linkedin_company_page"]
}
```

**Output**: List of companies with names and domains

Impressive what {company} is doing in the region. Would be great to connect.
```

**Fallback (no variables)**:
```

across your profile. Impressive work. Would be great to connect.
```

#### Touch 2: Intro Message (Day 1-2 after accept)
```
Thanks for connecting, {first_name}!

Quick context — I'm with [YOUR COMPANY]. We [VALUE PROP].

Curious if [PAIN POINT] is on {company}'s radar this year?

```

**Fallback**:

## Full Automation Script

For batch processing entire lists:

```python
# Pseudocode for full rollout
for company in hubspot_list:
    # 1. Search Apollo for C-levels
    prospects = apollo_search(
        company_name=company.name,
        titles=["CEO", "CFO", "CIO", "VP", "Head"]
    )
    
    # 2. Filter to those with LinkedIn URLs
    valid_prospects = [p for p in prospects if p.linkedin_url]
    
    # 3. Add to HeyReach
    heyreach_add_leads(
        campaign_id=CAMPAIGN_ID,
        leads=valid_prospects,
        sender_account_id=SENDER_ID
    )
    
    # 4. Rate limit (respect API limits)
    sleep(1)
```

C_LEVEL_TITLES = [
    "CEO", "CFO", "CIO", "COO", "CMO", "CTO",
    "Chief Executive", "Chief Financial", "Chief Information",
    "Chief Operating", "Chief Marketing", "Chief Technology",
    "Managing Director", "General Manager",
    "VP", "Vice President",
    "Head of", "Director"
]
```

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Connection Accept Rate | >30% | Industry avg: 20-40% |
| Reply Rate | >10% | Industry avg: 5-15% |
| Positive Response Rate | >3% | Interested/meeting booked |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Apollo returns 0 results | Try `q_organization_name` instead of `q_organization_domains` |
| HeyReach "fetch failed" | Check MCP server connection, retry |
| "Can't add to DRAFT campaign" | Add leads to the campaign's list instead |
| Missing fallback error | Add fallback message (no variables) to every Send Message node |

## Example Usage

**Single Company Test**:
```
User: "outbound Bank Aljazira"
AI: Finds 5 C-levels via Apollo → Adds to HeyReach → Ready to send
```

**Full List Rollout**:
```
User: "roll out to Top 100 - KD"
AI: Pulls 108 companies → Finds ~500 C-levels → Adds to campaign
```
