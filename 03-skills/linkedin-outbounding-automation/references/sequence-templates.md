Hi there,

Researching digital transformation leaders in Saudi banking and came 
across your profile. Impressive work. Would be great to connect.

### Intro Message (Day 1-2)
```
Thanks for connecting, {first_name}!

Quick context — I'm with Beam.ai. We build AI agents that automate 
complex ops like KYC/KYB and debt collection for financial institutions.

Curious if compliance automation or improving collection recovery rates 
is on {company}'s radar this year?

Happy to share how Americana and Swiss Re approached it — no pitch, 
just insights from the region.

### Follow-Up (Day 5-7)
```
{first_name} — circling back briefly.

I know your calendar is packed, so just one question:

Is automating manual compliance processes (KYC/KYB) or debt collection 
a priority for {company} in 2025?

We've helped VW and Swiss Re deploy AI agents that cut processing time 
by 80%+ while staying fully compliant.

Worth a 15-min call? If timing's off, just say so — happy to reconnect 
when it makes sense.
