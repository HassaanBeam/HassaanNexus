# Scope of Work Creation

Generate professional proposals and statements of work for client projects with clear phasing, success gates, and deliverables.

## Purpose

This skill automates the creation of comprehensive SOWs by:
- Structuring proposals with phased approach and success gates
- Defining clear deliverables, timelines, and cost breakdowns
- Establishing out-of-scope boundaries and client requirements
- Including security, support, and legal terms

**Key Features**:
- Phased approach with success gates (validate before advancing)
- Clear cost breakdowns and credit structures
- Deliverables mapped to each phase
- Out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep
- Professional formatting and structure

**Time Estimate**: 15-20 minutes per SOW

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Initialize TodoList

Create TodoWrite with all workflow steps:
```
- [ ] Gather project context and requirements
- [ ] Define phases and success gates
- [ ] Break down deliverables per phase
- [ ] Calculate costs and pricing structure
- [ ] Define out-of-scope items
- [ ] Add support, security, and legal terms
- [ ] Review and finalize SOW
- [ ] Close session to save progress
```

This creates transparency and allows progress tracking.

**Mark tasks complete as you finish each step.**

---

### Step 2: Gather Project Context

**Inputs Required**:
1. **Client Information**:
   - Client name
   - Industry and company size
   - Primary use case or problem
   - Technical environment

2. **Project Scope**:
   - Core objectives (what should be achieved?)
   - Success criteria (how to measure success?)
   - Timeline and urgency
   - Budget constraints or expectations

3. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Integrations needed
   - Security/compliance requirements
   - Infrastructure constraints
   - Data requirements

**Deliverable**: Context summary document

**Mark this todo complete before proceeding.**

---

### Step 3: Define Phased Approach

**Structure**: Create 2-3 phases with clear success gates

**Phase Template**:
```
Phase [N]: [Phase Name] ([Success Gate/POC/Production-Ready])

Cost: $[AMOUNT]

Deliverables:
- [Core feature 1]
- [Core feature 2]
- [Infrastructure/setup item]
- [Integration point]
- [X hours of engineering]

Success Gate: [Criteria for advancing to next phase]
```

**Success Gate Examples**:
- "Client is not obligated to advance to Phase 2 unless Phase 1 meets quality standards"
- "POC must demonstrate [specific metric] before production deployment"
- "Client can exit after Phase 1 with working pilot"

**Call Option Template** (if applicable):
```
Call Option for Phase [N]:
The Customer shall have a unilateral option to commence Phase [N] at any time up to and including the last day of Phase [N-1]. The Call Option may only be exercised by written notice via email to [Company] at [EMAIL] from an authorized representative.

Upon valid exercise:
- Phase [N] becomes billable according to payment terms
- Project scope and timeline extended by [X] weeks

If not exercised, Phase [N] shall not commence and no fees shall be due.
```

**Deliverable**: Phased project structure with success gates

**Mark this todo complete before proceeding.**

---

### Step 4: Define Deliverables and Pricing

**For Each Phase**:

1. **List Specific Deliverables**:
   - Technical deliverables (features, integrations, infrastructure)
   - Workspace/access setup
   - Documentation and training
   - Support and maintenance
   - Engineering hours included

2. **Calculate Pricing**:
   - Base cost per phase
   - Engineering hours breakdown
   - License credits (if applicable)
   - Total investment summary

**Pricing Structure Template**:
```
Phase 1: Core [Feature] Pilot
Cost: $[AMOUNT]
Deliverables:
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]
- [X] hours of AI agent engineering

Phase 2: Production-Ready [Feature]
Cost: $[AMOUNT]
Deliverables:
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

Credit: [X]% of Phase 2 cost applied to first-year platform license
```

**Deliverable**: Complete pricing breakdown with deliverables

**Mark this todo complete before proceeding.**

---

### Step 5: Define Out-of-Scope Items

**Purpose**: Prevent scope creep and set clear boundaries

**Categories to Address**:

1. **Additional Use Cases**:
   - "Scope limited to [specific use case]; other [category] automation is excluded"
   - Example: "Additional recruiting use cases - Scope limited to interview scheduling workflows only"

2. **Integrations**:
   - "Only [System X] integration is included; integrations with other [category] are excluded"
   - Example: "Only Thrive integration included; other ATS/HRIS integrations excluded"

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - "[Feature category] - [Basic version] included; [advanced version] excluded"
   - Example: "Basic admin dashboard included; advanced analytics, custom reporting excluded"

4. **Ongoing Support**:
   - "Support limited to [phase/timeframe]; post-[phase] maintenance requires separate agreement"
   - Example: "Support limited to POC phase; post-POC maintenance requires separate agreement"

**Deliverable**: Clear out-of-scope section

**Mark this todo complete before proceeding.**

---

### Step 6: Add Support, Security, and Requirements

**Support Section**:
```
Support:
[Company] will set up a joint communication channel (Slack/Teams) for direct customer support and fast issue resolution.

Client Requirements:
- Client provides API spec in compatible format
- Client supports API access/testing for integrations
- [Company] supports setup of future use cases during project phase
```

**Security Section**:
```
Security Requirements:
[Company] follows [SOC2/ISO 27001] standard for security and data privacy.

Measures include:
- Data Encryption: All sensitive data encrypted during transmission and storage
- Compliance: Agents comply with relevant data protection regulations
- Access Controls: Granular permissions restricting access to authorized personnel only
```

**Main Benefits Section**:
```
Main Benefits of [Solution]:
- Rapid deployment of operational MVP within [X] weeks
- Minimal technical team involvement for integration
- Scalability for future automation needs
```

**Deliverable**: Complete support, security, and benefits sections

**Mark this todo complete before proceeding.**

### Step 7: Review and Finalize

**Final Review Checklist**:
- [ ] All phases clearly defined with success gates
- [ ] Deliverables specific and measurable
- [ ] Pricing transparent with breakdown
- [ ] Out-of-scope items comprehensive
- [ ] Support and security requirements included
- [ ] Legal terms (call option) if applicable
- [ ] Professional formatting and structure
- [ ] Client name and use case correctly referenced throughout

**Present to user**:
1. Show complete SOW structure
2. Ask: "Does this capture all requirements? Any changes?"
3. Refine based on feedback
4. Generate final formatted document

**Deliverable**: Final SOW ready for client

**Mark this todo complete before proceeding.**

---

### Step 8: Share to Team (Optional but Recommended)

After using this skill successfully, consider sharing it with the team via Notion.

**To share**: Say "export this skill to Notion" or use the `export-skill-to-notion` skill.

**Skip this if**: Skill is personal/experimental or contains sensitive info.

**Mark this todo complete after deciding (share or skip).**

---

### Final Step: Close Session

Once the workflow is complete, **automatically trigger the close-session skill**:

```
Auto-triggering close-session to save progress...
```

**This is the final mandatory step.** Do not skip - it ensures all progress is preserved.

- Transparent cost breakdown builds trust
- Engineering hours show value
- License credits reduce friction
- Phasing spreads investment over time
