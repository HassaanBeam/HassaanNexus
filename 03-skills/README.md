# User Skills

This folder is for your **custom skills** - reusable workflows you create.

## Creating Skills

Say **"create skill"** to build a new skill from a workflow you repeat.

## How It Works

- User skills here take **priority** over system skills in `00-system/skills/`
- Each skill has a `SKILL.md` file with YAML metadata + workflow instructions

## Projects vs Skills

- **Projects** = One-time work (finite deliverable)
- **Skills** = Reusable workflows (repeatable process)
