# Memory

This folder stores your **persistent context** - information that carries across sessions.

## Auto-Generated Files

Memory files are **automatically created** on first startup:

- `goals.md` - Your role, goals, and work preferences
- `user-config.yaml` - Language, timezone, and system settings
- `memory-map.md` - Navigation guide for the memory system
- `core-learnings.md` - Accumulated insights from your work

## Personalizing

Say **"setup goals"** to personalize the auto-generated templates with your actual goals and preferences.

## Session Reports

The `session-reports/` folder stores summaries from completed work sessions (created when you say "done" or "close session").
