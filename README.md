# Nexus

> **Quick Start:** [Use this template](https://github.com/DorianSchlede/nexus-template/generate) → Clone your repo → Open in VS Code → Start Claude Code → Say "hi"

---

## The Problem You Have Right Now

Every time you start a new Claude session:
- You re-explain who you are and what you do
- You re-describe your project and where you left off
- You rebuild the same workflows from scratch
- You lose context, insights, and momentum

**What if Claude remembered everything?**

---

## See It Work (2 minutes)

**First Time:**
```
You: "hi"

AI: Shows Nexus menu with:
    🧠 MEMORY - Not configured ▸ 'setup goals'
    📦 PROJECTS - None yet ▸ 'create project'
    🔧 SKILLS - 26 available

    💡 SUGGESTED: 'setup goals' to teach Nexus about you

You: "create project for launching v2.0 dashboard"

AI: [Creates project structure, guides planning]
    ✅ Project created: 01-dashboard-launch
```

**Next Session:**
```
You: "hi"

AI: Shows your context:
    🧠 MEMORY - Role: PM at SaaS | Goal: Launch v2.0
    📦 PROJECTS - • dashboard-launch | IN_PROGRESS | 42%

    💡 SUGGESTED: 'continue dashboard-launch' - resume at 42%

You: "continue dashboard-launch"

AI: [Loads all context, shows exactly where you left off]
    "You're on Phase 2: Design. Next task: Review wireframes."
```

**That's the magic.** No re-explaining. Ever.

---

## What Makes This Possible

Nexus gives you three things:

### 1. Memory That Persists
Your role, goals, and learnings are saved in files. Every session, Claude loads them automatically. You never start from zero.

### 2. Projects With Structure
Work happens in **Projects** — with planning documents, task lists, and progress tracking. Everything auto-saves.

### 3. Skills You Can Reuse
Capture workflows you repeat. Say "create skill" after doing something useful, and it becomes a one-command action forever.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [ ] **Claude Code Account** — [Sign up here](https://claude.ai)
- [ ] **Visual Studio Code** — [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [ ] **Claude Code VS Code Extension** — Install from VS Code marketplace
- [ ] **Python 3.x** — [Download](https://python.org)

### Step 1: Create Your Nexus

1. Click **[Use this template](https://github.com/DorianSchlede/nexus-template/generate)**
2. Name your repo (e.g., `my-nexus`), click **Create repository**
3. Clone and open:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my-nexus.git
   cd my-nexus
   code .
   ```

### Step 2: Start Claude Code

1. **Open Claude Chat** via the Claude Code extension (click the Claude icon in sidebar)
2. **Say:** `hi`

The system activates automatically and shows the menu.

### Step 3: Start Working

You can start working **immediately** — no setup required!

| You Say | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| `"create project"` | Start a new project with guided planning |
| `"setup goals"` | Personalize Nexus with your role & goals |
| `"setup workspace"` | Organize your file folders |
| `"done"` | Save progress, end session |

### Optional: Learn the System

When you're ready, 6 optional learning skills teach you everything:

| Skill | Trigger | Time |
|-------|---------|------|
| **setup-goals** | "setup goals" | 8-10 min |
| **setup-workspace** | "setup workspace" | 5-8 min |
| **learn-integrations** | "learn integrations" | 10-12 min |
| **learn-projects** | "learn projects" | 8-10 min |
| **learn-skills** | "learn skills" | 10-12 min |
| **learn-nexus** | "learn nexus" | 15-18 min |

## The Three Core Concepts

### Memory — Your Persistent Context

The `01-memory/` folder stores who you are (auto-created on first run):

```
01-memory/
├── goals.md           ← YOUR role, objectives, success metrics
├── user-config.yaml   ← Language & preferences
├── core-learnings.md  ← Patterns that grow over time
└── session-reports/   ← Auto-generated session history
```

Every session, Claude loads these files first. It knows your context before you say anything.

### Projects — Structured Work

Projects have a beginning, middle, and end:

```
02-projects/01-dashboard-launch/
├── 01-planning/       ← overview.md, plan.md, steps.md
├── 02-resources/      ← Reference materials
├── 03-working/        ← Work in progress
└── 04-outputs/        ← Final deliverables
```

### Skills — Reusable Workflows

Skills capture actions you repeat:

```
You: "generate status report"

AI: [Loads skill → Follows exact steps → Produces report]
```

Create your own with `"create skill"` after doing something useful.

## Integrations

Connect your tools with natural language:

| Integration | Trigger | What It Does |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **Notion** | "connect notion" | Query databases, create pages, manage content |
| **Airtable** | "connect airtable" | Query bases, manage records, batch operations |
| **Beam AI** | "connect beam" | Manage agents, create tasks, view analytics |
| **Any REST API** | "add integration" | Auto-discovers endpoints, creates implementation plan |

Guided setup walks you through API keys and configuration.

---

## Workspace Map

Your `04-workspace/` folder is documented in `workspace-map.md` — a living map of your file structure.

**Why it matters:**
- Nexus reads this to understand where your files are
- It can find and organize things without asking
- New files and folders are automatically understood

**Keep it in sync:**
```
You: "update workspace map"

AI: [Scans 04-workspace/, updates documentation]
    ✅ Workspace map updated. Found 3 new folders.
```

Run this occasionally after reorganizing your files.

---

## Getting Nexus

### Option 1: Use as Template (Recommended)

1. Go to the [Nexus GitHub repository](https://github.com/DorianSchlede/nexus-template)
2. Click **"Use this template"** → **"Create a new repository"**
3. Name your repo, set visibility, click **"Create repository"**
4. Clone your new repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
   cd YOUR-REPO-NAME
   code .
   ```

This gives you your own copy where you can commit personal data (goals, projects, skills).

### Option 2: Direct Clone (For Trying It Out)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DorianSchlede/nexus-template.git
cd nexus-template
code .
```

Note: With direct clone, you can't push changes to the original repo.

---

## Getting Updates

Nexus receives regular system updates (new skills, improvements, fixes). Your personal data is **never touched** during updates.

### What Gets Updated

| Updated (from upstream) | Protected (your data) |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| `00-system/` | `01-memory/` |
| `CLAUDE.md` | `02-projects/` |
| `README.md` | `03-skills/` |
| | `04-workspace/` |
| | `.env`, `.claude/` |

### Automatic Update Checks

Updates are checked automatically on startup. When available, you'll see:
```
⚡ UPDATE AVAILABLE: v0.9.0 → v0.10.0
   Say 'update nexus' to get latest improvements
```

### How to Update

Just say:
```
You: "update nexus"

AI: UPDATE AVAILABLE: v0.9.0 → v0.10.0
    12 files will be updated

    Proceed? (yes/no)

You: "yes"

AI: ✅ Updated! Backup at: .sync-backup/2024-01-15/
```
